AUTHOR'S PREFACE
</h3>

<p class="t3">
TO THIRD EDITION
</p>

<p>
It has been strange indeed to revise this
book in barracks, amid efforts to learn
to fire big guns&mdash;possibly against the
Turks.  And yet this necessity which lies
upon us Englishmen to-day only emphasizes
afresh the importance of our trying to
understand the real problem of Islam.
</p>

<p>
When the war is over, Islam will remain.
Whatever state of disorganization it may
be in and whatever its centre, it will still
tower up before us gaunt and shadowed as
one of the most difficult problems of
civilization and as the great reproach of
the Christian Church.
</p>

<p>
We can do nothing to help Moslems, or
to solve their problem, unless we know
something of their story and have tried
to understand the power and fascination
of their rugged simple creed.
</p>

<p>
Those of us who are called to fight&mdash;for
honourable necessity&mdash;have the lesser task
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pvi"></a>vi}</span>
though it be costly. The real opportunity
will lie with those who come after&mdash;with
those, in fact, who are at school to-day.
Their task will be not to destroy but to
build, to dream holy dreams of a great
World Kingdom of Love and Gentleness
and Truth and Purity and Honour, and to
consecrate their lives to the One from
Whom and through Whom alone these
things can come.

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mecca.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Close to the focus of three great
continents, where East meets West and North
meets South, Asia almost touching both
Africa and Europe, lies the great unknown
country of Arabia, the 'Land of the Desert.'
</p>

<p>
The long, low coast-line of its western
shore is familiar enough to all who travel
to the East.  About seventy miles behind
that coast lies a wild chain of desert
mountains.  Here, in a valley snuggling among
massive peaks, is an Arab town, a kind
of mountain fastness, lying in an
amphitheatre of rugged hills.
</p>

<p>
It marks the spot, so the Arab legend
runs, where long years ago Hagar the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P2"></a>2}</span>
bondwoman laid her son, parched and
dying of a desert thirst, while she drew
away out of reach of his cries, and
'lifted up her voice and wept.'  Here,
too, is the well from which she filled
her bottle and gave the lad to drink,
reverenced to-day by all good Arabs as
the sacred well of Zemzem.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mohammed's Birth 570 A.D.
</span>
</p>

<p>
In this town of Mecca there lived in the
year 570 A.D. a young Arab widow mother.
She had not been married long when her
husband Abdallah joined a caravan on a
long trading journey up to Syria.  On his
way back he sickened of some desert fever
and died, and a son was born to her after
the father's death.  The child's grandfather
was a person of considerable importance,
the patriarchal head of the ruling
clan, the Koreish.  He took the boy in
his arms and went to the sacred temple of
Mecca, and gave thanks to God.  The
child was named Mohammed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Childhood.
</span>
</p>

<p>
His mother was poor, but she was of
noble family; and so, according to the
custom of Arab aristocracy, the child was
not nursed at home but entrusted to the
care of a woman of one of the wild wandering
tribes of the desert for his first five
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P3"></a>3}</span>
years.  The boy's earliest recollections
must have been of wild Bedouin life, in
which he grew strong and robust in frame,
trained in the pure speech and free
manners of the desert.  For little more
than a year he returned to his mother and
his home, but at the age of seven his
mother died, and he was left an orphan.
He was old enough to feel her loss very
deeply, and also the desolation of his
orphan state.  The shadow overcast his
life and turned his thoughts to melancholy.
His grandfather, Abd al Muttalib, was an
old man now, and Mohammed was his
favourite grandson.  He took the lad to
his own home and was more than ordinarily
kind to him; yet Mohammed never forgot
his mother, nor the sorrow of her death.
No doubt it did much to make him the
pensive, meditative man he afterwards
became&mdash;anyhow it set him thinking.
</p>

<p>
When he was eight years old the boy's
heart was again wounded by the death of
his kind grandfather and guardian.  With
him he had lived in the proudest home in
Mecca, for Abd al Muttalib had been a
kind of hereditary 'lord mayor' of the
town, whose special duty it was to take
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P4"></a>4}</span>
charge of the Temple and the Holy Well,
and to care for the many pilgrims that came
to visit them.  Now the 'clan' was left
without its proper head, and Mohammed was
given into the charge of his uncle, Abu Talib.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Education.
</span>
</p>

<p>
There was little ordinary 'schooling' for
the Arabs of those days, except for the
favoured few, and Mohammed, fatherless,
motherless, and now grandfatherless, was
not among these.  Probably he never even
learned to write.  His school was the
schooling of the desert and the caravan;
he was to become his uncle's 'handy-man,'
and for the present the best thing he could
do was to go and help in looking after the
camels and sheep which his uncle kept on
the slopes of Mount Arafat.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Arabs.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Who were these Arabs from whom
Mohammed sprang and among whom he
lived?  They were cousins of another
mighty race, the Jews, their neighbours,
for both traced their descent from
Abraham&mdash;the Jews through Isaac and
Jacob, the Arabs through Ishmael, and
also through Esau who married the daughter
of Ishmael.  In a marvellous way have
the Arabs all through their history been
fulfilling the old prophecy of the sons of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P5"></a>5}</span>
Ishmael: 'He shall be as a wild ass
among men: his hand shall be against
every man and every man's hand against
him, and he shall dwell in the presence
of his brethren.'[<a id="chap01fn1text"></a><a href="#chap01fn1">1</a>]  How better could we
describe the Arab to-day?  The description
was equally true in the days of
Mohammed.  Customs and ways of men
change slowly in the East when they
change at all, and the Arab all through
history has clung to the wandering and
warlike habits of his patriarch Ishmael,
and follows the same rude, natural mode
of life which existed in Arabia then.
</p>

<p>
The wild ass among men&mdash;independent,
haughty, hater of towns, dweller in the
wilderness, untameable;[<a id="chap01fn2text"></a><a href="#chap01fn2">2</a>] it is a description
that stirs our blood.  The Arab roves
through boundless deserts in wild and
unfettered freedom, despising a 'civilized' life,
scorning its comforts, proud and haughty in
mien and character, the one untameable
race of all the world.
</p>

<p>
In such a race was Mohammed born.
True, the Arabs were not all Bedouins of
the desert.  Towns had sprung up where
caravan routes crossed, or where rich wells
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P6"></a>6}</span>
and springs attracted a constant stream
of shepherds and camel drivers, or more
often around some spot consecrated by
tradition as holy ground, and by custom
as a place of pilgrimage.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mohammed's Shepherd Life.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Mohammed was a child of the town&mdash;a
Hadesi&mdash;but he was a child of the desert
too.  For the town dwellers of Arabia
were also her travelling merchants, and,
as in Joseph's time, they were known in
distant countries as men of merchandise
and caravan.  Like many a seer and
patriarch of old he spent some years in
shepherd life among the Bedouins who
tended Abu Talib's camels and sheep on
the slopes of Mount Arafat.  It was a
wild, open, and lonely life, such as has
developed the thoughtfulness and strong
self-reliance of many another man.  Long,
hot days under the burning tropical sun,
with the responsibility of valuable flocks
to be protected and fed, could not but train
his powers of observation.  Long, still
nights beneath the innumerable stars of
a rainless sky would develop a deep
wondering thoughtfulness in a boy already
inclined to melancholy and meditation, and
naturally taciturn.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P7"></a>7}</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mohammed visits Foreign Lands.
</span>
</p>

<p>
When he was twelve years old there
came to Mohammed the chance of visiting
foreign places.  Abu Talib proposed
joining a caravan that was going to Syria
where he had business to transact.  As
the caravan was about to start and Abu
Talib was mounting his camel, Mohammed,
overcome by the prospect of a long
separation, clung to his uncle, begging
to be allowed to join the party.  For
some months he served as his uncle's
caravan boy.  He had never before been
far away from home, and the long journey
through the desert northwards must have
strongly impressed his mind.  'The
imagination of the people had filled the
solitudes, as has been the case in all lands,
with supernatural inhabitants, monstrous
and malignant, the genii or djinns of the
<i>Arabian Nights</i>.  The horror of loneliness,
either in the night or in the equally silent
noontide, found expression in mysterious
tales and legends haunting every hill and
vale of the regions through which he passed.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mohammed meets Christians.
</span>
</p>

<p>
The caravan bivouaced wherever there
was water, preferably in any town or
trading centre.  Round the camp fire
in the evening the boy would hear much
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P8"></a>8}</span>
that was strange and new.  At Mecca he
had heard but little of the Jews and their
religion, and less of the Christians; but
there were many Jewish settlements on
this road up north, and at least a few
outposts of the Christian Church.  Christian
preachers of the Syrian Church preached
in the big centres, and we are told that
Abu Talib's caravan was at one time
entertained by Buhaira, a Christian monk.
</p>

<p>
In some of the places where the caravan
encamped they found settled Christian
communities with churches and crosses
and pictures, and other symbols of the
Faith.  Mohammed would hear how these
same rites were practised in the centre
of world-power&mdash;his attention would be
arrested by the fact that the great
Emperor owed allegiance to the Gospel.
He saw, too, how everywhere the Christians
were respected as men of learning.
</p>

<p>
But what was the Christian teaching
he would hear?  Alas! the Church of
Christ was rent by factions, and false
teaching prevailed, at any rate in the
East.  The simplicity which had
characterised the Church in the earlier days
when Christians were oppressed and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P9"></a>9}</span>
persecuted had passed away; as one of their
own historians put it, 'the World had
entered the Church.'  Christ Jesus had
no longer the pre-eminence; instead of
a rich consciousness of His glory and
beauty and power, the minds of Christians
were full of theories about Him and of
strange and false ideas of God.  The
Talmud and the Apocryphal Gospels, with
their crude, strange myths, were set beside
the Bible, and truth and falsehood were
dangerously intertwined.  Many had ceased
to believe in JESUS as indeed the Son of
God.  Some deified the Virgin Mary, giving
her a place in the Trinity; to them Jehovah
was no longer the God of the universe but
of the Jews only.
</p>

<p>
'In all probability Mohammed never
heard a word of the New Testament;
the pages of the Korân bear silent testimony
to the shameful fact that the only
way in which the Christianity of that
time and place reached Mohammed was
through the false Gospels.'[<a id="chap01fn3text"></a><a href="#chap01fn3">3</a>]
</p>

<p>
Even in these early days Mohammed
would ponder these things and sift them
in his mind, and if at this time he had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
longings and aspirations for a purer and
higher religion than the star worship and
crude idolatry of his countrymen, it need
not surprise us that such Christianity,
overlaid with myths and fables, and
confused by the worship of saints and images,
failed to satisfy his longings or to fulfil
his aspirations.
</p>

<p>
In later days, when Mohammed had
become the founder of a new religion and
the ruler of a mighty Empire, and was
acclaimed the Prophet of God, Moslem
writers began to weave strange and
unworldly incidents and miraculous signs
into the account of his journey&mdash;indeed,
into all the stories of his boyhood.  Angel
wings sheltered him from the noontide
heat, and withered trees were clothed
with leaves to give him shade, and a
strange fire is said to have played about
his head, marking him as the future
Prophet of God.  In reality the long
journey seems to have been uneventful
enough.

<p>
Yet on his return he would look on
Mecca with opened eyes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Kaaba.
</span>
</p>

<p>
We can picture Mohammed going sadly
back to the worship of the Kaaba and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
the religion of Arabia.  The Kaaba was
a small and simple building, almost a
cube as the name implies, about 27 feet
square and 34 feet high.  Originally
it had been the local sanctuary of the
Koreish tribe and contained only one
image, that of Hobal, their tribal god.
Long before Mohammed's days, however,
images of the local deities of other tribes
had been set up beside Hobal, until it
was a veritable pantheon, and was recognised
as the religious centre of all Arabia.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The 'Black Stone.'
</span>
</p>

<p>
The Kaaba's chief claim to this
distinction lay in the famous 'Black Stone'
of Mecca, which, encircled with a band of
silver, was built into its outer wall four
feet from the ground.
</p>

<p>
This stone is described as about six inches
by eight inches in size, of a reddish-black
colour, stained by sin, so the Arabs say,
and dotted with coloured crystals.  Its
history is shrouded in mystery and myth, but
Mohammed was taught to look upon it as
one of the stones of Paradise brought to
earth by the angel Gabriel.  Probably it
was an aerolite.  Then, as now, it was
regarded by all true Arabs as man's most
sacred possession, and was the object of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
pilgrimage to Arabs of all clans, and from
even the most distant parts, that they might
touch or kiss it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
An Arab Legend.
</span>
</p>

<p>
The story of the Kaaba is no less
mysterious and wonderful.  Originally
built to guard or mark a sacred spot
connected in Arabian legend with the
story of Ishmael, its true history has been
enshrouded and obscured in a cloud of
myths.  According to the inventive genius
of Arabian writers it was first constructed
in heaven 2000 years before the creation
of the world, and Adam erected a replica
on earth exactly below the spot its perfect
model occupies in heaven.  At the Flood
the sacred building was destroyed, and
God is said to have instructed Abraham to
journey from Syria to rebuild it with the
help of Hagar and Ishmael.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Religion of Arabia.
</span>
</p>

<p>
How uncouth and far behind the times
it all seemed!  The Jews had their
Prophet and law-giver Moses, the Nazarenes
looked to Jesus, the Persian magicians
quoted Zoroaster, even Abyssinia was a
homogeneous kingdom owning allegiance
to the Gospel.  Every nation had its
revelation and its Book;&mdash;Arabia had
none at all, no open vision, no Prophet,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
nothing certain.  It was but a tangle of
tribes and clans with hardly any cohesion
at all.  Each clan was a law to itself, a
separate unit, in competition with all
other clans, and the law of the blood-feud
tyrannized everywhere.  Such a
social organization was calculated to
ensure the maximum of confusion with the
minimum of achievement.  Mohammed
could not but contrast it all with the
definiteness, strenuousness, and order of
the political and social organizations which
he had seen abroad.  There could be no
law, for there was no ruler; no justice,
for there was no supreme authority; no
progress, for there was no plan.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
EARLY MANHOOD
</h3>

<p class="intro">
'The future comes not from before to meet us,
but streams up from behind over our heads.'&mdash;RAHEL
LEVIN.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mohammed's First Fighting.
</span>
</p>

<p>
So the years passed on, and Mohammed
grew from boyhood to youth, fair of
character and of honourable bearing among
his fellow citizens.  Though he shunned
the coarser sins and licentious practices of
the city he could no longer as a young
Meccan hold aloof from the civil and social
life of his day.  When he was about twenty
he received 'his baptism of fire,' and fought
in his first battle.  The Koreish were at
war with a neighbouring tribe.  The cause
of the war was insignificant enough, but it
is typical of the slight causes of the
blood-feuds of that day.
</p>

<p>
At certain seasons of the year it was
the custom of the tribes to gather at
the larger towns for fairs.  Of these the
most important was the sacred Fair of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
Ukaz, a large market town not far from Mecca.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A Blood-feud.
</span>
</p>

<p>
It was at one of these annual Ukaz fairs
that the trouble arose.  An arrogant
Koreish poet had been boastfully vaunting
the superiority of his tribe, and was struck
by a zealot of the Hawazin tribe.  A story
got about that a Hawazin girl had been
ill-treated by some Koreish maidens.  A
certain man of the Koreish was unable to
pay a debt to a man of the Hawazin tribe.
Arab blood boiled hot.  The Hawazin
creditor thereupon seated himself in a
conspicuous place in the market with a monkey
by his side, and proclaimed to all who
passed by, in the true Eastern language
of figure of speech: 'If you will give me
another such ape, I will give you in
exchange my claim on...' naming the
debtor, with his full pedigree, back to
Kinana, an ancestor of the Koreish.  This
he kept vociferating to the intense
annoyance of the Kinana, till one of them drew
his sword and cut off the monkey's head.
In an instant the whole Hawazin and
Kinana tribes were embroiled in bloody
strife.
</p>

<p>
The trouble was patched up at the time,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
but only to burst forth into a fiercer fury a
few years later, when a spiteful murder
supplied more serious cause of offence.
Then the fierce fire of tribal hatred was
unquenchable, and the whole country was
embroiled in a war which lasted for four
years, with short truces and respites, and
ended at last in the Koreish agreeing to
pay blood money in the shape of hostages
for the Hawazins they had slain.
</p>

<p>
Into some, at least, of the battles of this
war, Mohammed, then in his teens, accompanied
his uncle.  He seems to have played
no conspicuous or glorious part, and even
in later days, when he referred to it, it was
without enthusiasm or pride.  Perhaps he
discharged some arrows at the enemy&mdash;more
likely he acted as attendant to his
uncle, collecting arrows and handing them
to him to shoot.  Indeed, neither then
nor at any later period of his career was
Mohammed distinguished for his physical
courage or martial daring.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mohammed's Appearance.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Let us now introduce ourselves to our
hero himself.  His face has taken the set
features of manhood, and we may safely
apply to him the picture left by his
contemporaries of the man as they knew him,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
and as in later years they bowed beneath
his influence and power.  He was no Saul in
stature, though perhaps above the average
height; yet in his countenance there was
much that we are accustomed to expect in
a leader of men.  A Napoleonic nose, a
head too big for the body, flowing jet black
locks, falling on either side of his face,
intense, gleaming black eyes, slightly
bloodshot, an ample beard and moustache covering
a rather sensuous mouth must have given
him a striking and commanding appearance.
His skin was slightly fairer than that of
most Arabs, with a faint tinge of blue.
Across his ample forehead ran a prominent
vein, of which much is said, and which used
to swell and throb when he was angry.
Yet, withal, his face could have its gentler
moods; he could be kindly when he would,
and to the end he was a lover of children.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
His Manner of Life.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Such was his outward appearance; we
have some records, too, of his manner of
life among his fellow-citizens in
Mecca&mdash;records which show no trace of the man
that was to be; he was respected but
undistinguished.  From early manhood they
named him Al Amin&mdash;'The Faithful,'&mdash;and
he seems to have been regarded by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
his fellow-citizens as a solid, dependable,
brotherly, genuine man.  Passionate and
unrestrained, yet a serious, sincere,
character, capable of real amiability, and with
a good laugh in him withal.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Fair of Ukas.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Year by year would come fresh stimulus
to his active mind.  With his fellow-citizens
he went regularly to the annual fair
at Ukaz, probably on business as well as
pleasure bent.  This fair was indeed one
of the few institutions of Arabia which
could well be called 'national.'  Thither
during two sacred months of truce the
many scattered tribes gathered.  It was
the 'Olympia' of Arabia.  The rivalry
was not the rivalry of discus and
javelin, but of poetry and eloquence.
Ukaz was, indeed, the press, the stage, the
pulpit, the parliament, and the 'Academie
Française' of the Arab people.  It was
the focus of all the literature of Arabia.
Thither resorted the poets of these rival
clans and tribes, to a literary congress
without formal judges but with unbounded
influence.  And because it was the centre
of emulation for Arab poets, it was also
a kind of annual review of Bedouin virtues
and Arabian religion.  For it was in poetry
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
that the Arab&mdash;as indeed man all the world
over&mdash;expressed his highest thoughts.
</p>

<p>
At these fairs a strange assortment of
religious opinions would be found.  There
would be Christian preachers, probably
of many rival factions, each not only
proclaiming his 'gospel' but disclaiming all
the others, Jews and Sabæans, Zoroastrians
and Hanîfites, each with complete systems
of religion.  The orators of each Arab
tribe, too, vied with one another in
acclaiming the superior powers and merits of
their own tribal gods, their own sacred
spot or relics, and their particular
superstitious traditions.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Was there Hope of a United Arabia?
</span>
</p>

<p>
Though the discords were so great and
the causes of friction so numerous, these
discordant notes were sounding a kind of
harmony in the peaceful rivalries of a
national fair.  For in the long years of
history it was seldom that the peace of
the fairs was seriously broken, or the two
months' truce for attending them violated,
or the sacred spots of a tribe desecrated
by bloodshed.  How was this?  There
was no central government, no punitive
authority other than that of the tribe
which was in the ascendant at the time,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
or the strongest combination of clans allied
for the moment by some common interest.
It was not in the government that hope
for the future lay.

The Possibilities of the Arabs.
</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
(<i>a</i>) Germ of Belief in One Supreme God.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Was it in religion?  At the bottom of
all mythologies, at the back of the rudest
superstitions and crudest idolatries the
whole world over, there are fragments of
truth.  And in Arabia, lying so close to
the countries of God's earliest revelation
to mankind, we should expect yet more
than this.  Long centuries before, the
Book of Job had been written in Arabia;
Moses spent forty years there, leading a
Bedouin life in charge of the flocks of his
father-in-law; and Jethro, high priest of
Midian as he was, had prepared burnt-offerings
and sacrifices for the one true
God, confessing, 'Now I know that the
LORD is greater than all gods.'  The Queen
of Sheba journeying from the South to
see the wisdom of Solomon may have
taken back with her fragments of the
truth.
</p>

<p>
The wonder is that these sparks of light
had never burst into the flame of worship
of the one true God.  Instead they were
all but extinguished; none but a thoughtful
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
man would recognise behind the gross
fetishism, and the thousand petty gods
of the Arab tribes, acknowledgment of
the ancient belief in one supreme Deity.
Yet there it was, as history proves.  And
Mohammed saw it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
(b) Common Ancestry.  (c) Common Tongue.
</span>
</p>

<p>
There were two other common elements
which all Arabia shared: a common
ancestry giving them very marked national
characteristics and a strong Arabian
sentiment or patriotism; and a common tongue
spoken (with some variation of dialect) by
Bedouin and Hadesi all through that vast
land of desert.[<a id="chap02fn1text"></a><a href="#chap02fn1">1</a>]  These were both assets of
great value in Mohammed's future schemes.
Whether as yet he recognized their
possibilities we do not know.  Anyhow he was
no agitator.  After all who was he?  Only
his uncle's dependent.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mohammed's First Marriage.
</span>
</p>

<p>
As a rule in the East men marry
young, but Mohammed was an exception,
At twenty-five marriage and love came
to him rather than were sought by
him, and they were the making of his
life.  For there is no doubt that his wife
Khadîjah deserves to rank among the
great women of history.  During her
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
lifetime her great and strong influence
upon Mohammed kept him from stumbling
where afterwards he fell, and as she was a
woman of considerable wealth, marriage
very greatly altered her husband's material
and social position.
</p>

<p>
It happened in this wise.  Abu Talib,
finding his own family increasing faster
than his ability to provide for them,
bethought him of setting his nephew to
earn a livelihood for himself, and addressed
him in these words:
</p>

<p>
'I am, as thou knowest, a man of small
substance, and truly the times deal hardly
with me.  Now there is a caravan of thine
own tribe about to start for Syria, and
Khadîjah needeth men of our tribe to
send forth with her merchandise.  If
thou wert to offer thyself she would
readily accept thy services.'
</p>

<p>
To which Mohammed very respectfully
replied: 'Be it so as thou hast said.'
</p>

<p>
This sent Abu Talib off to visit Khadîjah.
</p>

<p>
'We hear that thou hast engaged such
an one for two camels, and we should not
be content that my nephew's hire were less
than four.'  To this she replied:
</p>

<p>
'Hadst thou asked this thing for one
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
of a distant or alien tribe, I would have
granted it: how much rather now that
thou askest it for a near relative and
friend?'
</p>

<p>
So the matter was settled, and
Mohammed went in charge of the caravan.
His sagacity and shrewdness carried him
prosperously through the undertaking, and
when with the caravan he retraced his
steps it was with a balance of barter
goods more than usually in his favour.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mohammed's Wooing.
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is quite a pretty picture, this, of
old-time romance, albeit Khadîjah was fifteen
years the senior.  She is sitting on the
roof surrounded by her maidens, on the
watch for the earliest glimpse of the
caravan, when a single camel is seen
approaching, the rider of which is soon
recognized as Mohammed, who has ridden
ahead of the caravan to bear his news as
quickly as possible.  And so, travel-stained,
yet flushed with his first success, he is
conducted up to the presence of his
mistress.  'She was delighted at all she
heard: but there was a charm in the
dark and pensive eyes, in the noble
features, and the graceful form of her
assiduous agent which pleased her even
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
more than her good fortune.'  And when
she had dismissed him with ample wages
she did not forget him.  Mohammed, too,
was heart-whole no longer, and became
melancholic and broody.
</p>

<p>
The ways of love are the same all
the world over and in all times, but its
etiquettes and customs vary.  And in
those days things in Arabia were not
as they are with us to-day, nor as they
are now in the East, where, by a strange
irony, owing to the very system which
Mohammed inaugurated, women are the
mere chattels of men, and know no such
liberty as that which brought him his best
fortune in his young days.
</p>

<p>
For it was Khadîjah that played the
first move in the game of courtship, and
she played it with a woman's adroitness
and discernment.  Her sister was her
accomplice.
</p>

<p>
'What is it, O Mohammed, which
hindereth thee from marriage?'
</p>

<p>
'I have nothing in my hands wherewith
I might marry,' was his very sensible reply.
</p>

<p>
'But if haply that difficulty were
removed and thou wert invited to espouse
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
a beautiful and wealthy lady of noble
birth&mdash;wouldest thou not desire to have
her?'
</p>

<p>
'And who might that be?' said
Mohammed, warming to her questions.
</p>

<p>
'It is Khadîjah.'
</p>

<p>
'But how might I attain unto her?'
asked Mohammed.
</p>

<p>
'Let that be my care,' was the reassuring
answer.
</p>

<p>
That was sufficient for him, and the
sister returned to Khadîjah, who then
lost no time in sending an open message
to Mohammed appointing a time when
they should meet.  Within the year they
were married with Arab ceremony by
Khadîjah's aged cousin, Warakah, who
blessed the union in homely Bedouin
language, declaring that Mohammed was
'a camel whose nose would not be struck.'
</p>

<p>
With Mohammed's marriage to Khadîjah,
his opportunity, if he were looking
for one, would seem to have come.  Free
from his uncle's patronage, freed, too,
from the carping cares of straitened
circumstances, or the necessity of working
long hours at some small task to earn his
daily bread, he had passed to a position of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
ease and affluence.  Henceforth he led no
camels or he led his own.  He was free to
shape his life as he would, while his wealth
and new position made him one of the
leading men of Mecca.
</p>

<p>
Now, if he had great thoughts, was the
time to make them known; now, if he felt
disquieted about the gross idolatry of the
people, was his chance to bear witness
against it; now, if he wanted to
revolutionize the old-world life of Mecca, he
had his vantage ground from which to
do so.  But instead, during those fifteen
years, from twenty-five to forty, so full
and strenuous in the life of most men
of action, Mohammed played no conspicuous
part,&mdash;the years passed by, and
on none did he write his name.
</p>

Of many incidents recovered by Mohammedan

scrap-heap of small provincial history, and
filled by them with portent and meaning,
one at least is worth recalling.  It reveals
a touch of that capacity for manipulating
men and circumstances which contributed
so largely to Mohammed's power in later days.
</p>

<p>
When he was in his thirty-fifth year, one
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
of those sudden, sweeping floods to which all
mountain districts are liable swept through
Mecca, and struck the Kaaba, tearing a
hole in the wall, damaging the contents,
and imperilling the roof.  To the
superstitious Meccans it was a portentous omen,
and they waited expectantly for some dread
visitation of the wrath of the gods whose
shrine had been thus desecrated.  As time
passed and no calamity befell them, and
less superstitious, or less reverent thieves
took advantage of its insecure condition to
pillage the shrine and plunder the sacred
relics, the leading men of Mecca met in
solemn conclave and decided that the
Kaaba must be rebuilt.  News reached
them of a Grecian ship wrecked on the
Red Sea shores not very far away.  The
timbers of the broken ship were bought, and
her Greek captain, who had some reputation
as an architect, was requisitioned to
direct the building.  The work was entered
upon with great trepidation, but when once
the ruined walls had been taken down
without any visitation upon the workmen
or the town, the work of rebuilding was
eagerly begun, and the various clans of the
Koreish vied with one another for what
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
they began to think the gods might after all
consider zeal of religion and not sacrilege.
</p>

<p>
The tribes of the Koreish were divided
into four parties, to each of which one
wall was assigned; stones of grey granite
from the neighbouring hills were carried
on the citizens' heads; soon the walls
began to assume their old familiar shape,
and all went harmoniously.
</p>

<p>
When the walls had grown to about four
feet high, a new difficulty arose.  They
had reached the place where the sacred
Black Stone must be masoned in, in its
accustomed place, in the outside of the
wall near the door.  Who should have the
honour of laying this heaven-given stone,
reverenced from time immemorial by all
true Arabs?  It was a puzzling question and
a contentious question, too, where there was
no king, nor even a prince with a special
genius&mdash;as, of course, all princes have&mdash;for
laying stones, nor was there any sacred
order of priest or patriarch to whom appeal
could be made&mdash;not even a cabinet minister!
</p>

<p>
It was settled thus.  As they stood beside
the wall disputing for the honour, the oldest
citizen arose and said:
</p>

<p>
'O Koreish, hearken unto me!  My advice is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
that the man who chanceth first to enter the
court of the Kaaba by yonder gate, he shall
be chosen either to decide the difference
among you, or himself to place the stone.'
</p>

<p>
The proposal was readily passed by
acclamation, and they waited the issue.
Presently Mohammed was seen approaching,
and all unknowing he entered the
chosen door.  Calm and self-possessed he
rose to the occasion.  Taking off his
mantle, he spread it on the ground and
placed the stone thereon.
</p>

<p>
'Now,' he said, 'let one from each of
your four divisions come forward and raise
a corner of this mantle.'
</p>

<p>
Four chiefs approached, and, holding
each a corner, raised the stone to the proper
level, and Mohammed with his own hand
guided it to its place.
</p>

<p>
The difficulty was solved and the walls
were soon completed, and the roof put
on&mdash;'of fifteen rafters resting upon six central
pillars.'  The Kaaba was complete once
more, though it is doubtful whether the
same respect and veneration could ever
again be commanded by gods who had
allowed a river to break up their sanctuary,
and men to handle and restore it.

</p>

<p>
Beyond the confines of Arabia two
mighty Empires were throbbing with the
activities of strenuous life, and the
back-waters of quiet Mecca could not remain
undisturbed.
</p>

<p>
A Meccan caravan expedition penetrated
into the heart of Persia with record success;
the spirit of enterprise was awake, and
new-world thoughts came into the old-world
city.  The growth of a small but influential
religious party called the Hanîfahs, led by
the aged Warakah, Khadîjah's cousin, had
struck at the roots of idolatry, and raised
the cry of 'Back to Abraham and his
simple worship of the one true God.'  This
told of a deepening thought and growing
dissatisfaction with the gross idolatry and
superstition which had hitherto done duty
for religion in Mecca.
</p>

<p>
By these currents Mohammed's outward
life was apparently as untouched
as that of any other average citizen.
Professor Davidson used to say that in youth
men get their visions, and see the glory
of the sun upon the distant mountains
of life's horizon, and the rest of life
is but a following&mdash;often through the
darkness&mdash;towards the light seen in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
youth.  If it were so with Mohammed he
gave little evidence of all that was passing
in his mind.  He lived a domestic life with
Khadîjah and a now growing family of
children, of whom he was very fond.  Every
evening he performed idolatrous rites in his
home, and he named at any rate some of his
children after heathen deities.  He filled
his place, no doubt, as a wealthy, and
therefore leading citizen of Mecca, but
beyond that he was known as a retiring,
thoughtful man, who preferred the
seclusion and quiet of home life to the rush
and scramble of the market and the
rostrum.

<p>
Who would have thought that this man
would mightily affect the destiny and
history of the whole human race, that he
would be the founder of an Empire which
within a hundred years would hold sway
from Cadiz to Bokhara, would annihilate
the Empire of Persia and lay siege to
Byzantium?
</p>

<p>
Who would have thought that twelve
hundred years after, this man's name,
coupled with that of the Almighty, would
be invoked in prayer by just over two
hundred millions of mankind, and proclaimed

THE PROPHET OF ARABIA

Mohammed's first 'Revelation.'
</span>
</p>

<p>
We come now to the event in
Mohammed's life about which there has
been both the keenest investigation and
bitterest controversy.  Scholars have
elaborated very different theories about the
'method' of Mohammed's inspiration,
partly because of its true importance as
the crisis and turning-point of his life, and
partly because men used to think that the
understanding of it was the key to the
reading of Mohammed's character.  Without
troubling ourselves with the various
conflicting theories, we shall confine
ourselves to what is sufficiently difficult&mdash;brushing
aside all fancies and excrescences
with which the records are garnished, we
shall tell as nearly as possible what
happened, or at any rate give Mohammed's
account of it.

<span class="sidenote">
Scene on Mount Hira.
</span>
</p>

<p>
It was Mohammed's custom&mdash;one not
uncommon in Arabia at that time&mdash;to
retire for a fixed season each year
to the seclusion of the rocks and ravines
which encircled Mecca.  One of these in
particular, a cave in Mount Hira, was a
favourite resort&mdash;a wild, bleak, barren spot,
in harmony with troubled heart and
wounded spirit.  And some suras
(i.e. chapters) of the Korân, almost certainly
composed at this time, reveal an intensity
of anguish and also a growing sense of
the reality of God&mdash;the following for
example:
</p>

<p class="poem smcap">
  'By the rushing panting steeds,<br>
  Striking fire with flashing hoof,<br>
  That scour the land at early morn;<br>
  And, darkening it with dust,<br>
  Cleave thereby the enemy:<br>
</p>

<p class="poem smcap">
  Verily man is to his Lord ungrateful,<br>
  And he himself is witness of it:<br>
  Verily he is keen after this World's good.<br>
  Ah! witteth he not that when what is in the<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;graves shall be brought forth,<br>
  And that which is in men's breasts laid bare:&mdash;<br>
  Verily in that day shall the Lord be well<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;informed of them.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
To this cave Mohammed had come with
his trusted wife, in his fortieth year, to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
spend the month Ramadân in undisturbed
meditation; in wrestling, we may believe,
with his own heart, and in contemplating
the eternal problem of the world's sin and
sorrow.  There, in the midst of prayers
and supplications, the light of revelation
seemed suddenly to burst upon him.
</p>

<p>
It was midnight in the cave when a
glorious angel appeared first in the sky,
then approached within two bow-shots'
length, holding a silken cloth written all
over.  The angel roused him from sleep
and bade him 'Read.'  'But I am not a
reader,' Mohammed replied.  Thrice was
the injunction repeated, the third time in
these words:
</p>

<p class="poem smcap">
  'Read, in the name of the Lord who created,<br>
  Created man from a clot of blood.<br>
  Read, for the Lord is the most beneficent,<br>
  He hath taught the use of the pen;<br>
  He hath taught man that which he knoweth not.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Then Mohammed repeated the words to
himself, and they were 'written upon his
heart.'  Then, we are told, he went to the
door of the cave, and remained standing
there till again there appeared his heavenly
visitant, 'in the form of a man, with wings,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
and with his feet upon the horizon,' and
saluted him: 'Mohammed, thou art the
Prophet of God, and I am Gabriel.'
</p>

<p>
Trembling and overstrung, Mohammed
returned to Khadîjah, and nestling close
beside her like a frightened child related
what had passed.
</p>

<p>
'Cover me, cover me,' he said.  'I fear
for my soul.'  She covered him with a
mantle and comforted him, saying:
</p>

<p>
'Rejoice: God will not put you to shame;
thou art so kind to thy relations, sincere
in thy words, afraid of no trouble to serve
thy neighbour, supporting the poor, given
to hospitality, and defending the truth.'
</p>

<p>
The visitations occurred several times,
and each time they were accompanied by
violent physical effects upon Mohammed.
'He was angry if anyone looked upon him:
his face was covered with foam, his eyes
were closed and sometimes he roared like
a camel.'
</p>

<p>
Even the faithful Khadîjah began to
have her fears.  Demon possession is a
common idea in the East.  'Could it be
that her exemplary husband was the
victim of the wrath of some genius of
evil?'  She consulted her cousin, Warakah,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
the sage and <i>savant</i>.  His answer was
wholly satisfactory, for he exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
'Holy! holy! by Him in Whose hand
Warakah's soul is, if thou has told me the
truth, then the Greatest Namus (nomos=law)
has come to him which also appeared
to Moses, and he is the Prophet of this
nation.  Tell him to be content.'
</p>

<p>
Still her fears were not allayed, and a
test was proposed.  She reasoned thus:
'If it is an evil spirit which visits my
husband, it will not be ashamed in the
presence of an unveiled woman, but if the
spirit is good he will surely be too modest
to remain.'  So with elaborate ritual the
test was laid.  Mohammed was to summon
her when next his visitant appeared, and
she was to take off her veil; should the
spirit depart, she would know him for a
good spirit.  The visitant fully vindicated
himself, disappearing from Mohammed's
sight at the appearance of an unveiled
woman; he never was visible to Khadîjah,
From that day onwards, through storm,
and shine, darkness and light, contumely
ridicule, and persecution, Khadîjah never
doubted, never wavered in complete
confidence in her husband and his message.

</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Days of Darkness.
</span>
</p>

<p>
For Mohammed there were yet many
searchings of heart.  He found himself
unable to summon his visitor, or to
command hours of inspiration at his will.
Three years, it is said, he waited for
another revelation, staggering in
uncertainty and doubt and darkness, driven
sometimes to the brink of despair, saved
from suicide once at least only by the
intervention of his wife.  Light seemed
to struggle with darkness in his soul, but
gradually certain grand verities stood out
clear.  'God, the sole Creator, Ruler, Judge
of men and angels; the hopeless wretchedness
of his people sunk in darkness and
idolatry; Heaven and hell, the Resurrection,
Judgment, the Recompense of good
and evil in the World to come.'  We can
gather something of the sombre realities
he saw, and something of the conviction
with which they came to him from some
of the suras written at the time:
</p>

<p class="poem smcap">
  'That which striketh!  what is it which striketh?<br>
  And what shall certify thee what the striking is?<br>
  The day on which mankind shall be like moths scattered abroad,<br>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
  And the mountains like wool of divers colours carded;<br>
  Then, as for him whose balances are heavy, he<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall enter into bliss;<br>
  And as for him whose balances are light, the<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pit shall be his dwelling-place.<br>
  And what shall certify thee what is the pit?  a raging fire!'<br>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The One God.
</span>
</p>

<p>
One great eternal truth alone stood out
before him, 'Lâ ilāha illâ 'llâhu.'  'There
is no God but God.'  Surely the discovering
of this great truth raised him high
above all Arabia.  'There is no God but
God'&mdash;he had discovered it, it had been
revealed to him&mdash;surely, surely he was the
favoured one, the Prophet of God; yes,
<i>The Prophet of God</i>.  It all seemed to
stand together, and he set it in one
sentence, Lâ ilāha illâ 'llâhu; Muhammadur
rasûlu 'llâh.'  '<i>There is no God but
God: Mohammed is the Apostle of God</i>,' and
so it stood for his creed, and the creed he
taught, and it stands to-day as the creed
of 200,000,000 of our fellow-men.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Early Followers of Mohammed.
</span>
</p>

<p>
There was another, too, besides Khadîjah
who from the first followed Mohammed's
fortunes with unwavering faith, a man
who is truly said to have saved Islam
twice.  He was a personal friend of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
Mohammed's, a popular but unimportant
fellow-citizen of Mecca, by name Abu
Bakr.  Through these early trying years
he was the propagandist of the new creed,
and won to his friend's side the first
little circle of Islam's converts.  Years
afterwards it was he who, as the first
Caliph, took the white banner from his
dying master's hands, raised it aloft again,
and rallied fortunes that seemed shattered
by the master's death.
</p>

<p>
With these two we must group another&mdash;a
man of different type and a very
different story&mdash;Zaid, a slave whom
Khadîjah had bought some years before and
presented to Mohammed,&mdash;this man proved
himself a faithful friend in darker days.
</p>

<p>
The little group was but a poor token
of the mighty armies Mohammed would
ere long lead.  Yet unquestionably a
conviction grows infinitely the moment
another believes in it; and these three
did believe with all their hearts.  Progress
was slow at first; Mohammed wished to
keep the matter as dark as possible, and
those who knew of this teacher and his
little band of disciples regarded them
as a small secret society, more or less
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
harmless&mdash;after all, there were other secret
societies in Arabia at that time.
</p>

<p>
In the first three years there were not
more than forty converts, won chiefly by
Abu Bakr's assiduous work.  It is much
easier to persuade people to believe in
someone else than to persuade them to
believe in yourself.  Abu Bakr saw this,
and right loyally did he play his part.
These forty were mostly from the lower
ranks of society, including slaves and
outcasts, who found here something of
a brotherhood and a fraternal generosity,
if not a community of goods.  As in
another small society in a Grecian city
five hundred years before, 'not many wise
men after the flesh, not many mighty, not
many noble' were called in those days.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mohammed's 'Revelations.'
</span>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the seasons of 'revelation'
had returned, and as time went on
Mohammed was able to summon them at will.
Each time the visitation was accompanied,
as before, by mysterious physical symptoms
and weird bodily contortions.  'His
countenance was troubled; he would turn
deadly pale or glowing red.  He would
cover himself with a blanket.  He fell
to the ground like one intoxicated; foam
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
would appear at his mouth; on the coldest
day the perspiration would pour from his
forehead.  Sometimes he would hear the
coming of the revelation like the ringing
of a bell.'  Sometimes the inspiration
would come in true dreams or 'suggestions
of the heart'; more often it was
Gabriel, once even it was said to be God
Himself speaking to him from behind a
curtain.  But when it was over he spoke
his 'suras' which his hearers laid to
heart, and afterwards noted down, and
so the Korân (or Recitation) was
compiled.  As a modern Asian quaintly puts
it: 'The heart of Mohammed was the
Sinai where he received the revelation,
and his tablets of stone were the hearts
of true believers.'
</p>

<p>
But as Mohammed claimed that these
physical seizures which he underwent in
times of revelation were evidences of the
reality of his divine commission, it was
natural that men's thoughts should stray
in search of other explanations thereof.
His friends remembered that as a boy he
had some sort of fit; others recollected
seizures of the kind; and men of science
and learning since, unwilling to ascribe the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
origin of the Korân to fits of epilepsy, have
shown how in such constitutions there
do lie rich but dangerous strains of high
emotion, and how a hysterical disposition
is not inconsistent with strength of will
and a high and lofty purpose.  It is an
obvious danger for such a nature possessing
great thoughts to become possessed by
them and be carried beyond the depth where
man may walk with sure and certain tread.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mohammed's Public Avowal.
</span>
</p>

<p>
After three years of these intermittent
revelations, and quiet work and conference
with his secret society, Mohammed felt
prepared to take the big step of his life,&mdash;to
come out and openly declare himself the
Prophet of Arabia and preach his doctrines.
He was the less afraid, perhaps, to do so
because he held that, except for the
all-important claim of his own Prophetship,
he taught no new doctrine at all.  Historians
and scholars since have abundantly
shown that all he taught was there before,
hidden, indeed, and scattered, without
coherence or cohesion, but there nevertheless.
Covered with fable and distorted
by superstition, it was part of Arabia's
sub-consciousness.
</p>

<p>
Tradition tells how the Prophet took
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
his stand on Al Safa, a hill outside Mecca,
and summoned the Koreish.  They were
followed by the Meccan mob, and to the
whole assembly Mohammed preached his
first public sermon.  The truths, indeed,
awoke an echo in their hearts; they could
not gainsay them.  But this was not truth
as a cold cinder raked out from the past
and from their national consciousness, but
truth living, burning,&mdash;truth on fire.  They
had heard of Allah before.  Here was a
man to whom Allah was a reality, so great
a reality that there could be no other god
but Him.  They would not have denied that
there was a life beyond the grave.  Here
was a man to whom God's universe was
an awful fact; who, as he poured forth his
invective, seemed to have himself gazed
upon the flaming fires of hell; to him
there was a world of difference between
heaven and hell and the paths that lead
to each.  Then, like some unexpected
cataract, he would burst into tumultuous
rhapsodies charged with thrilling words
of conviction and fervid aspiration,
insisting again on the realities of life, the
certainty of the Judgment, the peril of the
soul,&mdash;the soul of one believer outweighs
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
all earthly kingdoms.  They could no more
ignore this preaching than ignore the
pealing of the thunder.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Effect on Mecca.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Mecca was stirred to its depths.  What!
Was this man who had grown up among on
them indeed sent by God to overthrow
their sacred Kaaba, to tell them that the
gods they worshipped were no gods at all,
but wood and stone?  Their ancestors had
worshipped these same gods for centuries
before them.  Had not they themselves
prayed to Uzza and to Lât, and had
they not instances of answers to their
prayers?
</p>

<p>
Besides, if idolatry were a crime, what
became of the prestige of Mecca?  Where,
indeed, was their own livelihood?  Like
the silver-smiths of Ephesus they saw the
axe laid at the root of their prosperity.
Mecca owed its pre-eminence above all the
cities of Arabia to its guardianship of
the sacred shrine.  For that reason, too,
it was the one city which no Arab dared
attack: its people reaped a great benefit
from its central mart and a rich harvest
from the pilgrims, besides a heavy tribute
from the tribes.  It was no wonder, then,
that the Prophet's denunciations of their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
idols, his exposures of the grossness of
their worship, lashed the Koreish into fury.
</p>

<p>
Abu Talib, now the head of the clan,
expostulated, and sought to bring Mohammed
to reason, and begged him to renounce
the task he had undertaken, but he was
obdurate.  'O, my uncle, if they placed
the sun on my right hand and the moon
on my left, to force me to renounce my
work, verily I would not desist therefrom
until God made manifest His Cause, or I
perished in the attempt.'  There was no
persuading a man like that, although it is
recorded that in the course of the interview
he burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
Something had happened in Mecca which
Mecca could not hide.

CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
LIFE IN MECCA
</h3>

<p class="intro">
'We would know the world&mdash;not to censure, not
to boast ourselves, but that sympathy may be wider
and wider.'&mdash;LYNCH.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mohammed's Position as Prophet in Mecca.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Mohammed had now crossed the Rubicon.
He had taken the decisive step of his
career.  To turn back was impossible.
Islam was no longer a secret society.
The issues at stake were clear both to
Mohammed and to the men of Mecca,
and they opposed his attack upon their
shrine with a bitterness reinforced by
a kind of patriotism.  Mohammed himself
was inviolable through the protection
of Abu Talib, but an incessant petty
persecution was maintained against his
converts.  As the opposition increased
so did Mohammed's teaching grow in
positiveness, and his violent vituperations
increase in fury.  'Whoso obeyeth not
God and His Prophet, to him verily is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
the fire of hell.'  Mohammed was never
meek, and when assailed and contradicted
his cheeks blazed fury, while his lips
poured forth a torrent of curses upon his
enemies.
</p>

<p>
The advantage of secrecy during the
first few years had been great; it had
saved the cause from being crushed at the
outset.  Ridicule and contempt can more
easily be borne where some hundred
persons are involved.  Mohammed made his
public <i>début</i> not in the <i>rôle</i> of an eccentric
sage but as the leader of a party, a force to
be reckoned with; and soon his fame
spread along every caravan route of
Arabia.

'<i>Mohammed's fame spread along every caravan route of Arabia.</i>'
</p>

<p>
Mohammed now set up with some state
and dignity in a central position in the
'House of Al Arkam,' still famous throughout
the Moslem world as 'The House of
Islam.'  The house was put at his disposal
by one of his richer early converts.  Here
the Prophet held meetings of his followers,
received enquirers, and held audiences of
pilgrims and others who pressed upon him.
At these audiences Mohammed played the
Prophet's part to perfection; he wore a
veil, and assumed a benign and patriarchal
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
manner.  When he shook hands he would
not withdraw his first, nor would he remove
his searching gaze till the other turned
away.  His toilet, according to all accounts,
was very elaborate; every night he painted
his eyebrows, and he was strongly scented
with perfume.  Arab-like, he allowed his
hair to grow long till it fell upon his
shoulders, and when it began to turn grey
he dyed it.  He possessed the power of
winning confidence at slight acquaintance,
though it is said that new converts returned
often from their first audience not only
with a feeling of awe and chill, but of
dislike.  The stories of these meetings and
interviews show us the kind of rugged
earnestness of the man, and at the same
time the motives to which he appealed in
winning men's allegiance.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mohammed's Preaching.
</span>
</p>

<p>
One day, as he sat with the men of
Mecca in the common meeting-place
around the Kaaba, a certain Utba, whose
younger brother had recently joined the
new Faith, sat down beside him and said:
</p>

<p>
'O son of my friend, you are a man
eminent both for your great qualities and
for your noble birth.  Although you have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
thrown the country into turmoil, created
strife among families, outraged our gods,
and taxed our forefathers and wise men
with impiety and error, yet would we deal
kindly with you.  Listen to the offers
I have to make to you, and consider
whether it would not be well for you to
accept them.'
</p>

<p>
Mohammed bade him speak on, and he said:
</p>

<p>
'Son of my friend, if it is wealth you
seek, we will join together to give you
greater riches than any man of the Koreish
has possessed.  If ambition move you, we
will make you our chief, and do nothing
save by your command.  If you are under
the power of an evil spirit which seems
to haunt and dominate you so that you
cannot shake off its yoke, then we will
call in skilful physicians, and give them
much gold that they may cure you.'
</p>

<p>
'Have you said all?' said Mohammed;
and then, hearing that all had been said,
he poured forth on his amazed listener the
41st chapter of the Korân:
</p>

<p>
'This is a revelation from the most
Merciful: a book whereof the verses are
distinctly explained, an Arabic Korân,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
for the instruction of people who
understand....  It is revealed unto me that
your God is one God....  This is the
disposition of the mighty, the wise God.
If the Meccans withdraw from these
instructions, say, I denounce unto you a
sudden destruction....  The unbelievers
say, Hearken not unto this Korân; but use
vain discourse during the reading thereof,
that ye may overcome the voice of the
reader by your scoffs and laughter.
Wherefore we will surely cause the unbelievers
to taste a grievous punishment....  This
shall be the reward of the enemies of God,
namely, hell fire; therein is prepared for
them an everlasting abode, as a reward
for that they have wittingly rejected our
signs....  Say, what think ye?  If the
Korân be from God, and ye believe not
therein, who will lie under a greater error
than he who dissenteth widely
therefrom? ... Is it not sufficient for thee
that thy Lord is witness of all things?'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Conversion of Ali.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Another time we hear him preaching
publicly in a different strain: 'I know no
man in the land of Arabia who can lay
before his kinsfolk a more excellent offer
than that which I now make to you.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P52"></a>52}</span>
I offer you the happiness of this world,
and of that which is to come.  God
Almighty hath commanded me to call
mankind unto Him.  Who, therefore, among
you will second me in that work, and
thereby become my brother, my
vice-regent, my Khalifa (successor)?'
</p>

<p>
In the audience that day was his young
cousin, Ali, Abu Talib's son, whom
Mohammed had adopted shortly after his
marriage with Kadijah, and this sermon
is said to have been the cause of his
conversion.
</p>

<p>
'I, O Apostle of God, will be thy
minister,' he exclaimed; 'I will knock out
the teeth, tear out the eyes, rip up the
bellies, and cut off the legs of all who shall
dare to oppose thee.'  Then in the
presence of all the assembly the prophet
embraced him, exclaiming, 'This is my
brother, my deputy, my Khalifa: hear
him and obey him.'  In such manner did
this Peter of Islam receive his commission.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Conversion of Omar.
</span>
</p>

<p>
There is one other story of this time
which must be told.  Its central figure is
that of the man who later on succeeded
Abu Bakr as second Caliph, who captured
Jerusalem and Alexandria and conquered
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
Persia, and ruled an Empire as wide as
that of Rome.  He left for ever the stamp
of his dauntless spirit upon Islam.
</p>

<p>
He was one of Mohammed's bitterest
opponents and was engaged in elaborating
a plot upon the Prophet's life, when he
heard that his own brother-in-law and
sister were secret converts.  His wrath
was aroused and he proceeded at once to
their house.  As he drew near he heard
the low murmur of reading.
</p>

<p>
'What sound was that I heard just
now?' he demanded in his rage.
</p>

<p>
'Nothing,' they replied, as many have
done before and since.
</p>

<p>
'Nay,' he said with an oath, 'I hear
that ye are renegades.'
</p>

<p>
'But, O Omar, may there not be truth
in another religion than thine?'  The
argument ended in a free fight in which
the woman was injured.  Then at last
Omar showed some signs of manhood;
shamed by her bleeding head, he suggested
by way of compensation that he would
read the paper.
</p>

<p>
The sister persisted: 'None but the
pure may touch it.'
</p>

<p>
Then Omar arose and washed himself
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
and took the paper; it was the twentieth
sura, and he read it.  His mood completely
changed, and when he had finished
its perusal he said:
</p>

<p>
'How excellent are these words and
gracious.'  The brother-in-law was not
slow to follow up the opportunity.
</p>

<p>
'O Omar, I trust that the Lord hath
verily set thee apart for himself in answer
to his Prophet; it was but yesterday I heard
him praying thus: "Strengthen Islam,
O God, by Abu Jahl or by Omar.'"  That
completed the work of conversion, and
Omar proceeded boldly to the house of
Al Arkam and greeted Mohammed with
these words:
</p>

<p>
'Verily I testify thou art the Prophet
of God.'
</p>

<p>
Filled with delight the Prophet cried
aloud, 'Allah Akbar,' God is most great.
Henceforth Omar was a staunch follower,
of whom Mohammed one day said: 'If
Satan were to meet Omar, Satan would get
out of his way.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Persecution.
</span>
</p>

<p>
So there were added to the converts
men of very varying types, not outcasts
only now, but men of wealth, of learning,
and of social position.  As Mohammed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
grew stronger, opposition to him increased.
At one time a price was set upon his
head, and those of his followers who were
not protected by influential patrons were
persecuted and boycotted in the town.
</p>

<p>
Mohammed was by no means without
consideration for his followers.  The
persecution and violence, which befell especially
the slave portion of his adherents, pressed
upon him heavily.  In the fifth year of his
teaching he advised a large party of them
to seek refuge with the Christian King of
Abyssinia: 'Yonder,' pointing to the west,
'lieth a country wherein no one is wronged&mdash;a
land of righteousness.  Depart thither
and remain until it pleaseth the Lord to
open your way before you.'  A strange
step, it seems to us, when we reflect upon
the usage he and his successors meted out
to Christians in a few years' time.  It
reads not unlike a story of Huguenot
refugees of later days.  The Koreish sent
their envoys to beg the King not to harbour
the enemies of their country, who had
forsaken the religion of their fathers, and
were preaching another 'different alike
from ours and from that of the King.'  The
Moslem representatives refused to prostrate
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
themselves, as the custom was, saying
boldly: 'By our Prophet's command we
prostrate ourselves only before the one
true God.'
</p>

<p>
The Koreish set forth their case.  Then,
with that most convincing rhetoric of
simple, personal narration, the Moslems
declared how they had once been idolaters
till it pleased Allah to send them his
message through his apostle, 'a man of
noble birth and blameless life, who has
shown us by infallible signs proof of his
mission, and has taught us to cast away
idols, and to worship the only true God.
He has commanded us to abstain from all
sin, to keep faith, to observe the times of
fasting and prayer ... to follow after
virtue.  Therefore do our enemies
persecute us, and therefore have we, by our
Prophet's command, sought refuge and
protection in the King's country.'  We
are told that the King and his bishops
were melted to tears.  They offered the
exiles a safe asylum.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mohammed's attempted Compromise, c. 615 A.D.
</span>
</p>

<p>
In spite of the growth in the number of
his followers, Mohammed was much exercised
just at this time by the failure of his
mission: the fate of Islam seemed to be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
hanging in the balance, and once at least
he allowed himself to be betrayed into the
path of compromise.  He was preaching
one day in his accustomed place before the
Kaaba, and he recited the fifty-third sura:
</p>

<p class="smcap">
'By the star when it falleth your companion
erreth not, neither is he misled, nor speaketh
he from lust....  One taught him who is mighty
in power.  Have ye considered Al Lât and Al
Uzza and Manât, the third with them?  These
are the exalted maidens, and verily their
intercession may be hoped for.'
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The Koreish were as much delighted
as astonished.  This was <i>their</i> doctrine.
When he ended his sura with: 'Wherefore
bow down before God and serve
Him,' the whole assembly obeyed.  The
new popularity, however, disquieted him,
and he was man enough to see there could
be no sound building upon such a
compromise.  Besides, too, the very heart of
his message&mdash;the unity of God&mdash;was gone.
Accordingly, a few days later he publicly
retracted the verse, ascribing the words
to Satan.  Afterwards Mohammed dubbed
Uzza and Lât 'names invented by your
fathers, for which Allah has given no
authority.'  It was the first time, but not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
the last, that he went back upon revelations
which in the most solemn words he had
ascribed to God Himself.  But in the
circumstances his recantation was the act of
a strong man, and a brave one, for he
knew that the storm would break out with
greater fury than before.  Surely, unless
Mohammed found some hope in his own
heart through these long years of struggle,
his courage must have failed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Death of Khadîjah and of Abu Talib.
</span>
</p>

<p>
In the tenth year of his mission the
Prophet suffered two grievous losses in
the death of his faithful wife Khadîjah,
and his life-long protector Abu Talib.
Mohammed is said to have tried unsuccessfully
to get his dying uncle to pronounce
the Islamic confession.  He, therefore, was
doomed to hell, and the utmost that his
nephew could procure for him was that
while others would be in a lake of fire, he
should be only in a pool!  The Prophet
assured Khadîjah, on her death-bed, that
she, with the Virgin Mary, Potiphar's wife,
and 'Kulthum, Moses' sister,' should be
with him in Paradise.
</p>

<p>
When men recover quickly from a loss,
unworthy souls are all too quick to say that
they don't feel it.  And yet one cannot
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
suppress an exclamation of surprise and
shame when we find that within two or three
months of the death of the noble Khadîjah,
the wife, friend, and adviser of Mohammed,
he was married to another widow, by name
Saudah, and had betrothed himself also
to Ayesha, the seven-year-old child of Abu
Bakr.  Yet in these two months of pain
and darkness and apparent hopelessness
Mohammed had set forth upon an
expedition which, for sheer pluck and
determination, is hardly rivalled in the
story of his life.  A solitary man, despised
and rejected in his own city, he went forth
to try to plant his teaching in another.
As it turned out, his choice was an
unhappy one, for he was quickly mobbed
and driven forth, and Taif proved in future
years the last city of Arabia to hold out
against the new Faith.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mohammed's Failure to impress Mecca.
</span>
</p>

<p>
For six years or nearly seven Mohammed
had been patiently seeking to make an
impression on Mecca.  A very mixed band
of about a hundred converts of no particular
influence was the result.  There was
no turn of public opinion in his favour.
The outlook was dark, when a gleam of
hope shot across his path.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The men of Yathreb.
</span>
</p>

<p>
It was the time of the yearly pilgrimage:
Mohammed happened on a group
of men more open-eared than those of
Mecca.
</p>

<p>
He asked the city whence they came.
</p>

<p>
'We come from Yathreb,' they said.
</p>

<p>
'Ah,' said he, 'the city of the Jews.
Why not sit ye down a little with me and
I will speak with you?'
</p>

<p>
In the conversation which ensued
Mohammed was both learner and teacher;
expounding his doctrines, he at the same
time sounded the possibilities of Yathreb
for his cause.  The Jews, as all men knew,
looked for a prophet to come; the Arab
population of Yathreb were not bigoted
idolaters.  'What a different reception
they would give my teaching,' thought
Mohammed, and further inquiries only
strengthened his belief.  'This man, if he
could rule our quarrelling tribes, might
bring us peace and wealth once more,'
so thought the men of Yathreb.  For
Yathreb, although it was in one of the
richest valleys, and a veritable garden of
Arabia, was torn with civil strife, and was
plunged in poverty and distress.  They
were as much pleased as Mohammed.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
There seemed possibilities here, but there
was need of caution.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The First Pledge of Acaba.
</span>
</p>

<p>
A year of uncertainty and doubt
followed for Mohammed.  But when at the
ensuing pilgrimage he sought the spot
appointed for secret conclave with his
Yathreb friends, a narrow, sheltered glen
not far from Mecca, his fears vanished.
Twelve citizens of note and influence in
Yathreb were ready there to pledge their
faith to Mohammed thus:
</p>

<p>
'We will not worship any but one God:
we will not steal, neither will we commit
adultery, nor kill our children; we will
not slander in any wise, nor will we
disobey the Prophet in anything that is
right.'
</p>

<p>
It was a mild pledge by the side of what
Mohammed demanded later, and because
there was no mention of the sword it was
afterwards styled 'The Pledge of Women.'  But
it served for the present, and Mohammed
assured them:
</p>

<p>
'If ye fulfil the pledge, Paradise shall
be your reward.'
</p>

<p>
With statesmanlike restraint Mohammed
was content to wait another anxious year.
</p>

<p>
The twelve were now committed to his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
cause; he could count on their zeal to
propagate the new teaching and prepare
Yathreb for his coming.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Second Pledge of Acaba.
</span>
</p>

<p>
A year later, at the time of the next
pilgrimage, Mohammed, without attendant,
stands at the appointed trysting-place.  It is
midnight, for the utmost secrecy is
necessary, and they assemble 'waking not the
sleeper nor tarrying for the absent'; not
twelve but seventy men prepared to pledge
their troth this time in no doubtful words.
Yathreb, they report, is honeycombed
with the new teaching; a royal welcome
awaits the Prophet; they were prepared to
see it through.
</p>

<p>
'Our resolution is unshaken.  Our lives
are at the Prophet's service.'  'Stretch
out thy hand, O Prophet.'  And one by
one, with solemn Eastern ritual, the seventy
struck their hands thereon in token of
their pledge.
</p>

<p>
It only remained now to remove the
faithful in small parties to Yathreb, and
then for the Prophet and Abu Bakr to
follow with as much secrecy and as little
disturbance as possible.  For in the eyes
of the men of Mecca this was not merely
a change of residence but a transfer of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
allegiance&mdash;they might even call it sedition.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Hegira, of Flight to Medina, 622 A.D.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Abu Bakr was eager to set off, but still
the Prophet lingered, waiting, perhaps,
till his followers were all gone; perhaps
for some favourable omen (for he was
superstitious to the last); perhaps dreading
the long, toilsome, dangerous journey,
or, as he said, waiting till it was revealed
that the time was come.  Two swift
camels were bought and kept on high
feed in readiness; money in portable form
was prepared; a guide, accustomed to the
devious tracks of the desert, was hired.
</p>

<p>
At last the night arrived.  Stealing
through a back window, they escaped
unobserved through a southern suburb in the
opposite direction to Yathreb, and after
some hours' wandering, took refuge in a
cave near the summit of Mount Tûr.
</p>

<p>
They lay in hiding while Mecca raised
the hue and cry.
</p>

<p>
Miracles and legends cluster around
that cave and hide its Prophet.  Branches
sprouted in the night and hemmed it in
on every side, and wild pigeons lodged
upon them.  A spider wove its web across
the entrance.  Once again Islam hung in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
the balance.  Glancing upwards at a crevice
through which the morning light began to
break, Abu Bakr whispered:
</p>

<p>
'What if one were to look through the
chink and see us underneath his feet?'
</p>

<p>
'Think not thus, Abu Bakr,' the Prophet
replied; 'we are two, but God is in the
midst, a third.'
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile scouts had been sent in every
direction; but at last, opining that
Mohammed had escaped towards Yathreb by the
fleetness of his camel, they desisted.  Then
the fugitives came forth, and set out for
their desert journey of four hundred miles.
</p>

<p>
They were not quite 'out of the wood'
yet.  They met a scout returning from
the search.  A Bedouin encampment
where they sought food held elements
of danger.  But at length they reached
the garden outskirts of Yathreb, to be
known henceforth as El Medina&mdash;'The
City'&mdash;'The City of the Prophet.'  For
several days the town had been in eager
and excited expectation of its illustrious
visitor.  Still, with his unrivalled restraint,
Mohammed waited for four days to recover
from the effects of his journey.  On a Friday
he made his state entry amid the cheers of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
the populace, preached them a sermon of
religious exhortation and eulogy of the new
Faith, and in the midst of a circle of one
hundred believers, conducted before all the
people the first great Mohammedan 'Friday
Service.'  It was in the year of our era 622
Anno Domini, henceforth the 'First year
of Islam,' the year of the 'Hegira,' or
'departure,' the Flight of Mohammed
from Mecca to Medina.
</p>

<p>
Ten years of brave struggle, lonely
leadership, and self-restraint do not
diminish dignity: Mohammed rode into Medina
in all things fulfilling the highest Oriental
idea of the true king.

There is nothing to show that Mohammed
was ever a man of great foresight, or that
he saw in the distance a clear, guiding star
towards which he shaped his course.
Indeed, the constantly changing and
contradicting suras of the Korân show how his
views were altered and modified from time
to time.  He was pre-eminently a man of
the present, who understood how to deal
with present circumstances and make them
serve his ends.  How would he act now
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
that his chance had come?  He had claimed
to be a Prophet, nay <i>The Prophet of God</i>.
In Mecca he had been a preacher and a
warner only.  Was that all it meant?
The new opportunities of Medina made
him face the claim.
</p>

<p>
He had started with a two-clause creed,
'There is no God but God: Mohammed
is the Prophet of God.'  But he lost the
emphasis on God, and with that he lost his
balance.  'Mohammed is the Prophet of
God'&mdash;that was the clause men resisted
most.  That was what drove him to
persecute the Jews&mdash;when he no longer needed
their friendship&mdash;more harshly than he
persecuted others.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, what did this claim involve?
What did it mean in Medina&mdash;this city
without a visible head or any central
authority&mdash;to be <i>the Prophet</i> of God?
What was its meaning for Mecca, where
he had defied the many idols of the Kaaba?
What was his relation to Arabia?  What
was Arabia's relation to him?  Obviously
'the man who determined the fate of the
Kaaba must <i>ipso facto</i> be the chief of the
nation and remodel its entire structure.'  Who
would gainsay the Prophet of God?

First Year in Medina: Institution of Religious Observances.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile he must not go too fast, and
so Mohammed 'with the stolid patience
which in Europe belongs only to the
greatest, and in Asia to everybody,' waited
the year in peace&mdash;he spent it, in fact,
making his own domestic arrangements,
strengthening his own position, organizing
the practice of the Faith.  The empty plot
of ground at which Al Caswa halted was
bought, and upon it arose the first
Mohammedan mosque.  Beside it were
built two cottages, one for Saudah, the
wife whom he had married within a few
weeks of Khadîjah's death, and the other
for Ayesha, the child of Abu Bakr, only
nine years of age, whom he now took as
a second wife.

<br>
THE OBSERVANCE OF PRAYER.<br>
'<i>Typical of Mohammedanism in every century and in every clime.</i>'
</p>

<p>
The mosque was the first visible centre
of Islam.  As it rose he built, too, the
pillars of Mohammedan religious practice,
on which Islam has rested ever since.
Friday was established as the day of
assembly when he preached himself to the
people of Medina from a pulpit built of
tamarisk trees, by the outside wall of the
mosque.  The duty of ceremonial washing
(lustration as it was called) as a
preliminary to prayer was enjoined, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P69"></a>69}</span>
most typical of Mohammedanism in every
century and in every clime, the observance
of prayer at five stated times in the day.
The prayers, accompanied by a series of
four genuflections, were to be said facing
originally towards Jerusalem and later
towards Mecca.  These prayers soon became
the habit of 'the faithful.'  To-day they
are said in all the great mosques of the
East.  They are recited along every trade
route of the Sahara and Soudan where
the Arab drives his lonely caravan; they
are used by saint and ascetic, brigand
and slave-dealer alike&mdash;wherever men call
themselves after the name of the Prophet.
</p>

<p>
But none of these provisions so well
illustrate Mohammed's judgment and his
æsthetic sense as his institution of the call
to prayer by the human voice, and not by
Jewish trumpet or Christian bell.  It is
said that the suggestion came from Omar.
He communicated it to the Prophet, who
cleverly replied that a special revelation
to that effect had just been given him.
Anyhow, the negro slave, Bilâl, was soon
shouting the call from the highest turret
in Medina, and the weird music of the
muezzin's voice from myriads of minarets
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P70"></a>70}</span>
still floats across the air from Cape Verde
to Muscat, from Suez to Nankin, summoning
one out of every seven of the entire
human race to worship five times a day.
<i>'God is most great!  I witness that there
is no God but God, and Mohammed is the
Apostle of God!  Come to prayer!  Come
to salvation!  God is most great!  There
is no God but God!'</i>  At dawn is added
the very human reminder, '<i>Prayer is better
than sleep!</i>'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mohammed's Followers in Mecca.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Such were the religious observances of
Islam, together with legal almsgiving, the
duty of the jihad, or holy war, the
reconsecrating of the old Arab fasting month of
Ramadân, and a few solemn feasts.
Mohammed added nothing in later years
except that most meritorious of acts&mdash;a
pilgrimage to Mecca.
</p>

<p>
By these religious enactments the Prophet
drew the faithful closer to him, and
separated them from the 'unbelievers'
and the 'disaffected' of Medina.  Their
enthusiasm for him knew no bounds.
Converts struggled for the honour of
washing in the water which the Prophet
had used for his ablutions, and then drank
it up.  It was bottled and sent to new
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P71"></a>71}</span>
adherents as precious liquid, after the style
of the relics of saints.  His barber was
surrounded by a crowd of eager Moslems
who scrambled for Mohammed's hair and
nail parings, which they preserved as
charms and relics.  They accepted every
word of his, as he affirmed they should,
as the veritable words of God.  So much
for the inner circle, the 'believers' in
Medina.
</p>

<p>
The great majority of the people, if not
actively opposed, were far from being his
allies.  With great astuteness and
cleverness Mohammed sought to gain first one
party, then another.  He instituted a new
kind of brotherhood, binding, with oaths of
the most complete mutual allegiance, a
Medinese to one of the followers who had
joined him from Mecca.  The tie was to
supersede even the ties of kindred; one
man was even to inherit from the other.
The system did not last long, but it did its
work by tiding over many of the difficulties
of the first twelve months.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Jews.
</span>
</p>

<p>
The Jews, as we have said, formed a
large colony in Medina, all the more
influential because they were&mdash;as they
have ever been&mdash;homogeneous.  One of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P72"></a>72}</span>
Mohammed's first steps was to make
overtures to them.
</p>

<p>
They worshipped the same God, he said,
and it was 'quite simple for a Jew to obey
the law of Moses and yet owe his allegiance
to Mohammed!'  So he poured forth suras
in their favour, quoted&mdash;or misquoted&mdash;the
Old Testament in his sermons, and even
adopted some of their ceremonial.  He
finally made a formal treaty with them,
declaring common cause against idolaters,
and, in particular, against the Koreish of
Mecca, permitting to the Jews their own
religion, but insisting 'None shall go forth
but with the permission of Mohammed.'
</p>

<p>
The treaty was short-lived.  It was soon
plain that Judaism and Islam could not go
hand in hand.  The Prophet rested his
claims on the predictions of the Jewish
Scriptures: yet he did not profess to be
the Messiah;&mdash;the Messiah, he held, had
already appeared in the person of Jesus,
and had been rejected.  He was himself
another and a greater prophet also
foretold in their Book.  The Jews, he said,
knew this; they recognized in him the
promised Prophet 'as they recognized their
own sons,' yet, out of jealousy and spite,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>
from wilful blindness, they rejected him,
as they had rejected their own Messiah.
This was the position which Mohammed
held.  How could the Jews accept it?  In
a body, with but few exceptions, they
rejected it.  Henceforth, Islam and Judaism
were no more allies.  The suras suddenly
changed their tone; each new revelation
poured forth fresh invectives upon Israel.
Jewish customs were discarded, and 'the
faithful' were bidden to turn no longer to
Jerusalem but to Mecca for their prayers.
The rupture was a severe blow to Mohammed
at the time; but he consoled himself,
inasmuch as the Jews had always been a
stubborn race, given to rejecting their
prophets.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Heathen.
</span>
</p>

<p>
The first impetus had begun to expend
itself.  Progress was slow, though in
Medina converts were still many.
Indifference dulled the mass of the people;
rival chieftains asserted their claims over
the clans.  Mohammed and his followers
were often in want.  Mecca, too, had
settled down to its life without a regret
for the one man singled out as the chosen
of God.  The position was not consistent
with the dignity of the Prophet of God.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P74"></a>74}</span>
Circumstances converged to show that in
force lay the only remedy.  Mecca must
be punished, and Medina should learn that
the hand of God is with His Prophet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Marauding Expeditions.
</span>
</p>

<p>
The commerce of Mecca depended very
largely upon the caravan expeditions which
travelled twice a year to Syria, passing on
their way along the Red Sea shore, not far
from Medina.  To break up and plunder
the caravan was not a difficult and
certainly was an effective way of punishing
Mecca, and, incidentally, of replenishing
the dwindling resources of the 'brotherhood'
of believers.  Some of them did,
indeed, revolt against such a step,
remembering how they had been taught more
merciful practices at Mecca, but
Mohammed was ready for them with a new
revelation, reminding them that to punish
those who had driven out God's Prophet
was to defend the honour of God.
</p>

<p>
The earlier marauding expeditions came
back with empty bags.  The first found
the Meccans too carefully and strongly
guarded.  The second, though stronger in
numbers, shot one arrow and turned tail.
The third was to catch a caravan at a
place where the roads from Syria and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>
Egypt meet, five days from Medina; it
arrived a day too late.  Mohammed decided
to lead the fourth himself, but again the
Meccans, knowing no doubt by this time
what to expect, gave them the slip.
Mohammed, however, succeeded in forming
an alliance with a heathen tribe not
disinclined to similar enterprise, and
through whose territory the caravan route ran.
</p>

<p>
A month later news reached Mohammed
that along this road would pass a very rich
burden, laden on 2,500 camels, and
protected by 100 armed men.  This time he
summoned the Medinese to his white
standard, and marched forth at the head
of 200 followers.  But the safety of a
desert caravan lies not so much in
numbers as in cunning, and even this huge
unwieldy caravan outwitted the highwaymen
and passed on its way in safety.
</p>

<p>
It was not an encouraging beginning
for Moslem arms, but it brought men under
the magnetic sway of Mohammed's leadership;
it established Mohammed's right to
drill and command the believers, and it
whetted their Arabian appetites for blood
and plunder.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P76"></a>76}</span>
</p>

<p>
When a man has once justified himself
for highway robbery&mdash;and this was not
hard for one who claimed to be the Prophet
of God in Arabia in the seventh century&mdash;it
was easy for him to justify worse methods.
Mohammed's followers had failed before
armed troops&mdash;there was still another
way.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The 'Believers' break the Sacred Truce.
</span>
</p>

<p>
During the month Rejeb, all Arabia
acknowledged a sacred truce, so fully
recognized that caravans travelled
unarmed.  One of Mohammed's followers,
Abdallah, was known as a desperate
fanatic, who was said to have prayed
that he might die fighting and be
mutilated.  Mohammed put this man in charge
of a small force, and sent him forth during
the month of Rejeb with sealed orders.
These were to take no men who shrank
from such a job, but with the others to
lie in ambush in the gorge of Nakhla for
a small, unprotected caravan of rich
merchandise which was travelling without
escort under cover of the sacred month.
On reaching Nakhla they had not long to
wait.  In a short time a caravan, richly
laden with wine, raisins, and leather, came
through the defile.  It was driven by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P77"></a>77}</span>
four men of the Koreish, who grew
alarmed and halted at the sight of armed
strangers.  To disperse their fears, one of
Abdallah's followers shaved his head in
token that they were peaceful travellers
returning from a pilgrimage.  The men
of the caravan, at once reassured,
unloaded their camels and began to prepare
their evening meal.  While they were
doing so, Abdallah and his five stalwarts
set upon them.  Of those in charge of
the caravan one was killed, two taken
prisoners, and the fourth, leaping on his
horse, escaped to Mecca.  Abdallah
returned with the two captives and the loot
to Mohammed, who at first professed
reluctance at accepting booty won by such
a sacrilegious act, but soon got over his
own scruples and satisfied those of the
believers by distributing the booty and
by giving forth a fresh revelation declaring
'it is less evil to break the sacred
truce than to expel God's Prophet.'
</p>

<p>
It was a desperate business indeed, for
it was a violation of the conscience of all
Arabia, but it was successful.  It was
sanctioned by Mohammed, and it set the
example and kindled the 'fire' of Islam
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
all down the centuries.  If the truce held
sacred from time immemorial by all Arabia
might be violated in the name of the
Prophet of God, and be so obviously
successful, what might not be done?
Moreover, Mohammed promptly poured forth
fresh suras, promising Paradise to all who
fell in war 'for God and His Prophet,' and
declaring war against the infidel a main
duty of the faithful.  The rich spoil and
splendid future were too much for the
men of Medina; open opposition
disappeared, the Medinese were Mohammed's
followers.

CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
THE SWORD OF ISLAM
</h3>

<p class="intro">
'The sword of Mohammed and the Korân are
the most stubborn opponents of civilization, liberty,
and truth the world has ever known.'&mdash;SIR WILLIAM MUIR.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Civil War.
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is a small step from 'robbery under
arms' to civil war.  The logical
consequence of a small expedition, if it is
successful, is a larger one.  Mohammed
soon had a chance, which it was not in
him to refuse.  He heard that the large
caravan which had eluded him in the
autumn was returning in the spring,
crawling down the sea route on its way to
Mecca, heavily laden with goods, to the
value of 500,000 francs.  Its leader was
Abu Sufyan, the chief of the Koreish, and,
as usual, every Meccan who could afford it
had a stake in the venture.  Mohammed
appealed to the men of Medina, 'Here is
a caravan of the Koreish in which they
have embarked much wealth.  Come!
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
perchance the Lord will enrich you with
the same.'  The appeal was not in vain.
With an army of 305 men and 70 camels
he marched to meet it at Badr, still a
halting-place on the pilgrim road from
Syria to Mecca.  Meanwhile, through spies
or traitors, the news reached Abu Sufyan,
who sent to Mecca for help.  The men of
Mecca, not without misgivings at making
war upon their relatives, turned out for
battle nearly a thousand strong.  This was
more than Mohammed had reckoned on,
but he was not dismayed.  He could
count on the fiery courage of his followers,
the fanaticism of his 'refugees' had
destroyed all their remembrance of the ties
of kindred; he reckoned, too, no doubt, on
hesitation and divided councils among his
foes.  He was cheered in the night with
visions of success, and with stern
confidence he ordered the battle himself.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Battle of Badr.
</span>
</p>

<p>
The field of battle was a valley between
the two most western spurs of a range of
mountains which here drop into the plain
which protects them from the sea.  A
rivulet, rising in the inland mountains, runs
through the valley, and in its course a
number of cisterns had been dug for the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
use of travellers.  Mohammed ordered all
of these to be filled up, except the one
nearest to the enemy, and this one he
made his base of operations.  He was quite
aware that 'the general should not risk
his life,' and, accordingly, a temporary
hut was built for the Prophet beside
the well, and fleet camels were picketed
ready for his flight in case of sudden
need.
</p>

<p>
The battle began, like many another
in those parts, by single contests of the
champions of either army.  In these the
Moslems won all along the line.  It was
an ominous beginning for the Koreish,
and their spirits sank.  It was a wild,
stormy, winter day, and the rain poured
in the face of the Meccan archers, as upon
the hapless French at Agincourt.  To
Mohammed the fierce blasts that swept
the valley were a legion of angels under
Gabriel and Michael fighting for the
believers&mdash;as the 'Great Twin Brethren'
had fought for Rome at Lake Regillus.
The Moslems fought, it seems, in a sort
of threefold phalanx formation, and at first
stood on the defensive.  The Koreish were
without commander, without order, or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
discipline, or any concerted plan, though
they were three to one.
</p>

<p>
The battle raged fiercely: at last the
fiery valour of the Moslems prevailed.
As the foe wavered Mohammed stooped,
threw a handful of pebbles towards them,
and cried: 'Confusion seize their
faces.'  Wavering turned into defeat, defeat into
rout.  The Koreish cast away their arms
and fled, abandoning their camp and
baggage and beasts of burden.  Eagerly
the Moslems followed them, slaying and
taking captive all who came within reach.
Forty-nine were killed, and about the same
number taken prisoners.  Mohammed lost
only fourteen, of whom six were refugees
from Medina.  Many of the principal men
of the Koreish were slain, among them
one of Mohammed's bitterest opponents,
Abu Jahl.  As he lay wounded on the
field Mohammed's servant ran upon him
and cut off his head and carried it to his
master.
</p>

<p>
'The head of the enemy of God,'
exclaimed Mohammed.
</p>

<p>
'God, there is none other but He,'
responded the servant, as he cast the gory
head at the Prophet's feet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P83"></a>83}</span>
</p>

<p>
'It is more acceptable to me than the
choicest camel in Arabia.'
</p>

<p>
Six of the prisoners were executed as
avowed enemies of Mohammed's creed.
The remainder were treated with kindness,
and most embraced the faith.  A trench was
dug upon the field into which the bodies of
the slain were cast, and before it was filled
in, Mohammed himself addressed them in
the presence of his followers: 'Have you
not found the promise of your Lord to come
true?  Woe to you who rejected me your
Prophet.  Verily, my Lord's promise to
me hath been made good.'  The spoil was
very rich; it was thrown into one great
heap, of which Mohammed retained a fifth,
and divided the rest among his followers.
Two camels fell to the lot of every man in
the army.
</p>

<p>
The battle of Badr was to Moslem
history all, and more than all, that Hastings
means in the history of England.  To
Mohammed, and to every man who fought
under him, it was the seal of the Almighty
upon the Cause.  Obviously for purposes
of war one Moslem was worth ten unbelievers!
A course of plundering so favoured
by God Himself was not to be desisted
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P84"></a>84}</span>
from&mdash;each fresh marauding expedition
added to the wealth of Medina and the
reputation of the Prophet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Siege of Medina.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Once, twice, indeed, the life of
Mohammed and the cause of Islam yet
hung in the balance.  The Koreish, as we
might guess, had not taken the defeat of
Badr easily, and were resolved on revenge.
A year later, with an army of 3,000 men,
they marched on Medina, and so narrowly
was Islam saved that we are told
Mohammed was himself struck down during
a panic of his followers.  Two years
later, summoning all their allies, the
Koreish marched upon Medina and besieged
it with an army 10,000 strong.  But
finding earthworks and trenches barring
their way, and plot and stratagem met by
counter-plot, their provisions ran out and
they were forced to beat an ignominious
retreat.  Even temporary set-backs hurt
little the reputation of the Prophet.  He was
the unquestioned master of Medina now,
and each succeeding month brought fresh
tribes within his suzerainty; his reputation
extended wherever Arab orators contended
for eloquence.  But as yet he was only a
local notability.  Arabia still looked to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P85"></a>85}</span>
Mecca as the pivot of the country; the
men of Arabia still returned to Mecca and
the Kaaba for their yearly pilgrimage.
Clearly, if Mohammed would rule Arabia,
he must rule from Mecca.  Under truce
he visited his old haunts, the home of his
youth and the sacred 'cube,' but he was
only there on sufferance.  The visit
intensified the burning desire, and the urgent
necessity for the Prophet of God to be
Master of Mecca.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Conquest of Mecca.
</span>
</p>

<p>
So, passing over several years studded
with incident and adventure, we must
follow our hero with his organized and
disciplined army of 10,000 men as he
marches upon Mecca.  Such an army
Araby has never known and the Koreish
make but small show of resistance.  A few
fanatics keep up a running and ineffectual
fight, and Mohammed stands lord of the
city from which eight years before he had
fled a hunted fugitive.  It is still full of
enemies.  But the greatness of his triumph
has softened his heart, and by his moderation
he wins theirs.  The men of Mecca
give in their adhesion, and become
'believers' in a body.
</p>

<p>
The first act of the Conqueror was one
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P86"></a>86}</span>
of clemency.  What was the second?
Remounting his old favourite Al Caswa
he rode to the Kaaba&mdash;the pictures had
been removed, and Mohammed now ordered
the idols to be hewn down.  Uzza and Lât
fell with a terrible crash, and with them
crashed down the whole fabric of Arab
idolatry, which has never been restored.
</p>

<p>
Mohammed was an old man now, and as
he contemplated the work of destruction,
he must have felt that the labour of twenty
years had not been in vain.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mecca the Centre of Islam.
</span>
</p>

<p>
To him, however, the destruction of the
idols was not so much the end of the old as
the beginning of the new.  The Kaaba
itself was left untouched, and was
consecrated to be the new centre of the new
faith, and from its roof Bilâl sounded the
call to prayer.  The keys were returned
to their old keeper, and the right of
attending the pilgrims was entrusted again
to Mohammed's uncle Abbas.
</p>

<p>
Mecca should still be the pivot of Arabia,
its sacred shrine the centre of its religion,
the Koreish its guardians, but not henceforth,
as in the 'days of ignorance,' a house
of helpless idols, but the centre of the new
religion&mdash;'God and His Prophet.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P87"></a>87}</span>
</p>

<p>
It was the stroke of a master statesman,
as well as of a religious enthusiast.  It
silenced the scruples of the Koreish lest
Mecca should lose its position and they their
chance of livelihood.  It was the crowning
act of Mohammed's achievement.  Verily
the hand of God must be with the Prophet
when he could conquer Mecca and defy with
impunity the ancient deities of Arabia!

The Subduing of Arabia.
</span>
</p>

<p>
So the fire of Islam was kindled in Arabia.
A few more fierce stubborn contests yet
remained, a guerilla fight with the powerful
and bellicose Arab clan, the Beni Hawazin,
the blockade of Taif, a powerful hostile
city, and the subjugation of the Jews, and
all Arabia was aflame.  From Yaman and
Hadramaut and Oman, from the borders
of Syria and Persia, envoys poured in,
bringing the allegiance of the tribes,
flocking to the white standard of the
Prophet.  Within a year Mohammed, at
the head of such an army as no Arab
had ever dreamt of, consisting of 10,000
horse and 20,000 foot-men, marched northwards
to the borders of Syria, and subduing
the Christian and semi-Christian tribes of
the north, carried the fire of Islam beyond
the borders.

Religious and Social Life.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Busy and occupied with fighting as those
last years of Mohammed's life were, his
work as religious prophet was not neglected.
He poured forth fresh suras as each new
occasion demanded.  True, they seem to
have lost their old rugged earnestness
now, and much of their sense of God, but
he declares them still to be the revelation
of the Almighty, and to have existed in
heaven from the beginning of eternity.
Many suras are concerned with the most
trivial and unimportant matters treated in
the most commonplace way.  Some show
his unrivalled skill in getting out of difficult
personal or political situations.  Some are
to give 'divine authority' for his own
violations of his own law, or for those
actions of his which outraged even the
primitive conscience of Arabia.  One
instance of this should be given.  Within a
year of his reaching Medina the Prophet
greatly admired Zainab, the wife of his
foster-son Zaid, and coveted her for his
wife.  Marriage to one who was reckoned
a daughter-in-law was utterly abhorrent to
the conscience of the Arabs, but he justified
this by obtaining a divine commission&mdash;a
divine blessing forsooth&mdash;for the act.  We
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P89"></a>89}</span>
have more than once seen how the Prophet
fell into the very convenient habit of
retracting or 'abrogating' any previous
suras which he found it convenient to
alter.  One would have thought this would
have shaken the faith of the 'believers' in
the revelations, but Mohammed waved their
scruples aside with a high hand, and they
soon grew accustomed to such vagaries.
</p>

<p>
Interspersed among these very minor
matters was much advice as to the conduct
of the faith, the obligations of Moslem
brotherhood, the relation of the faithful
to unbelievers, to women and to slaves.
Many Arabian customs were commended
for adoption.  There were disquisitions on
criminal and civil law and punishments,
on political economy and tax-collecting,
and florid descriptions of the believers'
Paradise and the fires of the unbelievers'
Hell.

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mohammed's Death, 632 A.D.
</span>
</p>

<p>
A man's age is not reckoned by his
years, but by the life he has lived.  The
last twenty-three years of Mohammed's life
had been enough to shatter the strongest
of constitutions.  Privation, persecution,
struggle, anxiety, fear, and still more, the
lust, excitement, and excesses of victory,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P90"></a>90}</span>
and, as he said, 'the toil of inspiration and
the striking' had streaked his hair with
grey, and made him old when he was
sixty-three.  But he was game to the end, and
fought his fever inch by inch.  When
it was sore upon him he struggled to
the mosque to lead the Friday service.
Throughout Sunday he was unconscious.
On the Monday he rallied so far as to be
able to walk feebly into the mosque next
door, where Abu Bakr led the prayers at
his request.  He returned exhausted by
the effort, and quietly sank to rest in
Ayesha's loving arms, muttering a few
broken prayers for forgiveness 'for the
former and the latter sins,' and exclaiming
'The blessed companionship on high!'  Around
him were gathered his wives and
those who had been his closest friends and
comrades through good report and ill&mdash;Abu
Bakr, Omar, and Zaid.
</p>

<p>
We may, in fancy, stand with that little
company and gaze deep into that quiet
face, for thereon is written not only a life
that is past, but a forecast of a history
that is yet to be.  Yes, Mohammed, the
story of thy life is there, a story unique in
glory and in shame; in glory because, rising
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P91"></a>91}</span>
above thy fellows and realizing God, thou
didst preach Him to men; in shame, because,
being greater than thy fellows, thou didst
think thyself almost a god.  And in the
pages of world-history thy life is written
large across the nations, for, as is the
prophet so are the people, and where
the shepherd leads the sheep follow.  And
so thy life, its glory and its shame, its
moral earnestness, its sordid ambitions;
its rugged sincerity, its obvious self-deception;
its high moral teaching, its gross
sensual sins; its gentleness, its cruelty;
its faithfulness, its broken oaths; its
daring, its cowardice; its saintliness and
its brigandage; will live again in the
lives of thy followers wherever men call
themselves Mohammedans.

Mohammed claimed a final Revelation.

<p>
With the passing of the Prophet, Moslem
revelation is for ever closed, the last word
has been said, no more is possible.  At his
death there can be no successor to his office
as mediator and Prophet.  The two assets
upon which the huge and complex structure
of Islam have been built are the
historical records of <i>the Prophet's life</i> and
<i>the Korân</i>, and it is important that we
grasp the meaning of this fact.  Zwemer

influence.

'He is at once the sealer and abrogator of all
former prophets and revelations.  They have not
only been succeeded, but also supplanted by
Mohammed.  No Moslem prays to him, but every
Moslem daily prays for him in endless repetition.
He is the only powerful intercessor in the Day of
Judgment.  Every detail of his early life is attributed
to divine permission or command, and so the very
faults of his character are his endless glory and his
sign of superiority.  God favoured him above all
creatures.  He dwells in the highest heaven, and
is several degrees above Jesus in honour and
station.  His name is never uttered or written
without the addition of a prayer.  "Ya Mohammed"
is the open sesame to every door of difficulty&mdash;temporal
or spiritual.  One hears that name in
the bazaar and in the street, in the mosque and
from the minaret.  Sailors sing it while hoisting
their sails; hammals groan it to raise a burden;
the beggar howls it to obtain alms; it is the
Bedouin's cry in attacking a caravan; it hushes
babes to sleep, as a cradle-song; it is the pillow of
the sick, and the last word of the dying; it is
written on the door posts and in their hearts, as
well as, since eternity, on the throne of God; it
is to the devout Moslem the name above every
name; grammarians can tell you how its four
letters are representative of all the sciences and
mysteries by their wonderful combination.  The
name of Mohammed is the best to give a child,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
and the best to swear by for an end of all dispute
in a close bargain....  Mohammed holds the keys
of heaven and hell.  No Moslem, however bad his
character, will perish finally; no unbeliever,
however good his life, can be saved except through
Mohammed.'[<a id="chap06fn1text"></a><a href="#chap06fn1">1</a>]

The Korân.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Then there was the book, the Korân.
At the time of Mohammed's death the
suras had never been gathered together,
and no book of them existed.  Many had
been written down by those who heard
them, some the faithful knew by heart.
Soon after the Prophet's death Abu Bakr
gave orders that all these should be
gathered together.  Zaid therefore
collected all that could be found on parchment,
leather, palm leaves, shoulder-blades
of mutton, stones, and other materials, and
with those suras which could be repeated
from memory he completed the collection
of Mohammed's suras in the Korân.  Every
word within the covers of that book was, and
always has been, regarded by all Moslems
as the veritable word of God, 'eternal and
uncreate,' brought down from heaven by
Gabriel and delivered to Mohammed.  'The
whole of the contents of the Korân, from
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P94"></a>94}</span>
the sublimest doctrine down to the most
trivial command abrogated perhaps a week
or two after it was revealed; from the
passage describing the ineffableness of God
down to the passage authorizing Mohammed's
marriage with the divorced wife of
his adopted son&mdash;all is equally, in kind and
in degree, inspired, eternal, and divine.'  The
word of God to man was, in fact,
a book,&mdash;this book.  This book was the
word of God.

<br><br>
ISLAM'S SUCCESS
</h3>

<p class="intro">
'A poor shepherd people, roaming in its deserts
unnoticed since the creation of the world: a
Hero-Prophet was sent down to them with a word they
could believe: see, the unnoticed becomes the
world-notable, the small has grown world-great; within
one century afterwards, Arabia is at Grenada on

and splendour and the light of genius, Arabia shines
through long ages over a great section of the world.
Belief is great, life-giving.'&mdash;CARLYLE.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Wonder of Islam's Success.
</span>
</p>

<p>
We have not yet exhausted the amazing
phenomena of Islam, nor have we solved
its greatest riddle.  We watched the
orphan camel-boy grow into a man; we
studied the events which made this man a
giant among his fellows; we stood beside
him through those long years of conflict,
during which he gathered a few followers
about him, and won from them a passionate
devotion to his person and an unwavering
faith in his cause, which made him soon
the acknowledged Prophet and master of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P96"></a>96}</span>
Arabia.  It is a wonderful story, but it
is not unintelligible, and there are other
stories in history not unlike it.  We
attribute them to that wonderful and mysterious
power which we call personal magnetism.
But the amazing wonder of Islam is this,
that arising in the heart and mind of one
single man, founded apparently upon
devotion to his person, centring upon him
rather than on any system that he founded
(for Mohammed made no provision for a
successor), it went forth to work its greatest
wonders after he had gone.  For a few
months, indeed, Arabia wavered, the
Bedouin tribes 'started aside like a broken
bow' and revolted; but Abu Bakr, by a
perfectly magnificent exhibition of fortitude,
faith, and skill, proved that he was
the successor of the Prophet, inheriting
from his master that one thing which
carries conviction to every Arab&mdash;<i>success</i>.
United for the first time in their history,
the fierce tribes of the desert poured forth
to the conquest of the world.  Mohammed
had stamped Islam upon Arabia.  His
successors and their wild, earnest armies
stamped Islam upon the world.  With
Arabia, and only Arabia, at their backs,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P99"></a>99}</span>
they turned and faced the great empires
of the world, and in a few years were
stamping them beneath their feet.  Neither
the legions of the Roman Empire, nor the
hosts of Chosroes, the great king of
Persia, could stand before them.  Like
some irresistible prairie fire, Islam spread
within one century over Palestine, Syria,
Persia, Egypt, and Northern Africa, and
from Africa it leapt across to Europe and
established itself in Spain; reducing, it is
calculated, 36,000 cities, towns, and castles,
destroying 4000 Christian churches and
replacing them with 1400 mosques.

<hr>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Progress of Islam from Eleventh Century.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Nor was this all.  Flaming up again in
the eleventh century, Islam enveloped Asia
Minor and the Balkans, and most of the
Great Soudan, and as though driven by some
western hurricane, swept eastward over
Asia across the Turkestans to China, and
from Persia down the passes of the Hindu
Koosh to Kashmir, Afghanistan, and India.
Nor was its fire spent then.  The eighteenth
century and the nineteenth saw its hungry
flame burst forth afresh, spreading further
westward across the Great Soudan and
southwards into Central Africa.  The
twentieth century sees Islam spreading
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P100"></a>100}</span>
with incredible speed, though deprived of
its sword, down to Sierra Leone and Lagos
in the west, up the Nile Valley and down to
South Africa, threatening to engulf the
native Christian churches in Uganda,
Livingstonia, Nyassaland, and even in
British South Africa, offering an example
in missionary enthusiasm which the Church
of Christ may well covet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Present Position.
</span>
</p>

<p>
We have taken a big leap over 1200
years.  We left Abu Bakr, the first Caliph,
at the head of his Arab host, marching out
upon the world.  We find the Moslem still
to-day seeking new worlds to conquer,
still the same stalwart, virile enthusiast
for the Faith.  How is it?  Whence comes
this spirit?  What is this spirit that is in
him?  Can it ever be explained?  Can it
ever be accounted for?
</p>

<p>
We shall have the best hope of understanding
it if we go back in thought again
to the battle of Badr, or join the fierce,
eager armies of Abu Bakr or Omar (the
second Caliph) as they go forth to war&mdash;to
fight some of those battles which must ever
stand among the greatest of the world's
history.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Causes of Success. (a) Belief in One God.
</span>
</p>

<p>
(1) As we move amongst these fierce
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
soldiers we realize that beneath their
glaring Arab faults, their hot passions, their
love of fighting, their love of booty, one
strong conviction holds them.  They have
come to believe in God: a dim consciousness
of Him they had had before, now many at
least of the 'believers' believe passionately,
and with all their hearts, that the
one Almighty God had revealed Himself
through His Prophet.  To believe that,
knowing nothing of His mercy, His justice,
and His love, is enough to make men
fanatics.  Every Moslem warrior felt
himself to be the 'Sword of God.'  Therefore,
these men of the desert carried everything
before them, because they had a conviction
and believed in it with a faith that bore
down the superstition of the pagans, the
subtleties of the philosophers, and the
empty controversies which, alas! had
taken the place of a living faith within the
Christian Church.  The thunder of their
cavalry was not more terrible to the enemy
than the clamour of their short, sharp
battle-cry and creed, 'There is no God but
God: Mohammed is the Apostle of God.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
(b) Plunder and Paradise.
</span>
</p>

<p>
(2) But however brightly burned the
Arab's zeal for God, the cause was not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P102"></a>102}</span>
without enticements of a very concrete
and attractive nature.  The prospect of
plunder and Paradise played a big part.
These uncivilized, simple-living Arabs were
fighting against two mighty, rich, and
luxurious empires.  The very first battle
with Persia revealed such spoils as no
Arab had ever even dreamt of.  And so,
from the very first, the invading armies
had the intoxicating hope of spoils that
were greater and richer by just so much as
Rome and Persia were greater and richer
than Arabia.  Mohammed knew the Arab
heart, and instituted the plan of dividing
the spoils among the soldiers; and the
captured women were given to them for
wives and concubines.  These things acted
as new wine to the Arabs.  God was indeed
with them!  What wonder that all Arabia
believed in the Prophet's doctrine of the
Jihâd&mdash;the duty of fighting in the path of
God&mdash;and became one huge depôt for the
army of the Faith!
</p>

<p>
And Paradise.  It, too, had come as a
new hope to the pagan Arab&mdash;a paradise,
so the Prophet painted it, where every
desire of man would be fulfilled; a place
of gardens and flowers and fruits, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P103"></a>103}</span>
maidens such as never were seen, full
of sensual delights that appealed to the
base appetites of ribald soldiery&mdash;and
its best places were for those who fell in
war for the Faith.  So real and so attractive
was it to his warriors, that they dashed
into the fight heedless whether it was
plunder or Paradise that they would gain,
choosing often for the latter, never doubting
it one single instant.  Khâlid, the famous
general of the early Caliphate, spoke truly
in his splendid message to the Persian
general&mdash;'A people is upon thee, loving
death as thou lovest life.'
</p>

<p>
We heard Mohammed summoning Medina
to the battle of Badr.  He did not
hesitate then to appeal to the
plunder-motive, nor did the early Caliphs and
their successors ever since.  Mothanna,
who led the Moslem soldiers against the
army of Persia&mdash;their first trial of strength
against the organized army of a mighty
empire&mdash;'haranguing his troops at the
outset of the campaign, and, in the very first
flush of religious enthusiasm, says much
of plunder, captives, concubines, and
forfeit lands, but not one word about Islam,
God, and the Faith.'  Sir William Muir
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P104"></a>104}</span>
tells the story of a Moslem soldier eighty
years old who, seeing a comrade fall by
his side, cried out, 'O Paradise, how close
thou art beneath the arrow's point and
the falchion's flash!  O Hâshim, even now
I see Heaven opened, and black-eyed
maidens all bridally arrayed, who clasp
thee in their fond embrace.'  True to its
formal character, Islam asks no question
as to motives of 'belief.'  Those who
struck for God alone, or for God plus
Paradise, or for Paradise and plunder
without God, or for plunder pure and
simple, were all the 'Blessed of the Lord,'
heroes and saints, and, if they perished,
martyrs in the 'path of God.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
(c) Simplicity of Creed and Practice.
</span>
</p>

<p>
(3) The simplicity of Islam was and
always has been part of its charm.  That
simplicity is without doubt supposed rather
than real; still, for the peoples whom the
Moslem hosts conquered, and on whom,
moreover, they imposed their Faith, it was
simple enough&mdash;God and His Prophet;
Islam&mdash;we must submit to God.  Once
that was acknowledged, the ritual of
Moslem religious practice easily followed.
It swept away the superstitious fears of
pagan peoples, and the sectarian animosities
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P105"></a>105}</span>
of feeble Christians.  It made but the
smallest demands upon the character of
a man, and gave but the slightest curb to
his passions.  Then, as now, he might be
bandit, assassin, adulterer, anything but a
drunkard or a denier of the Prophet, and
yet the best of fighting Moslems.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
(d) Patriotism of Arabs.
</span>
</p>

<p>
(4) No nation that is not utterly
degenerate, whatever its government or
lack thereof, whatever its divisions, is
impervious to a patriotic cry that summons
a nation to realize itself, to be united in
one common cause and take its place
among the other nations of the world.
This and more than this Mohammed
meant to Arabia, and Draper has showed
us how quickly the Arabs passed through
the various stages of intellectual and
national life.[<a id="chap07fn1text"></a><a href="#chap07fn1">1</a>]  Till almost the end of the
Prophet's life (632 A.D.), Arabia was an
unknown and quite negligible peninsula
to the civilized world.  A century later
(732 A.D.) the Saracens (as the Moslems
came to be called), conquerors of Spain,
were fighting a seven days' battle at
Tours on the banks of the Loire with
Charles Martel, the Frank.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P106"></a>106}</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
(e) Enthusiasm of a Great Cause.
</span>
</p>

<p>
(5) Is it suggesting another cause, or
is it perhaps the sum of these four, to
say that, once it was going, it was the
enthusiasm of a great campaign that drove
the Moslem hosts along?  History has shown
what this can do in lesser causes.  What
was it sustained the Carthaginian soldiers
as they painfully followed Hannibal through
the passes of the Alps?  What sustained
Napoleon's troops through the miseries
of that Russian winter?  Was it the
purpose, or was it the fact that they had a
purpose?  Was it discipline and fear, or
enthusiasm for their general's name?
Before Mohammed's time, an Arab lived
to drive his camel and attend his caravan.
Now there was a purpose&mdash;a Divine
purpose&mdash;for every Arab's life, a cause
demanding all his manhood and perhaps
his life.  To carry the white standard of
the Prophet to the limits of the world
in a great and glorious campaign&mdash;that
was the will of Allah!
</p>

<p>
There are few things in history more
magnificent than the picture of Ugba
leading his army across Syria, Egypt, Tunis,
Tripoli, Algiers, Morocco, to the Atlantic
shore, and urging his horse into the waves,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P107"></a>107}</span>
exclaiming, 'Great God, if I were not
stopped by this raging sea, I would go on
to the nations of the West, preaching the
unity of Thy Name, and putting to the
sword those who would not submit.'
</p>

<p>
There are few things to-day more
magnificent than the zeal of the average
Moslem for his Faith.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The 'Method' of Islam.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Such was the spirit that stirred in the
heart of these Moslem hosts and sent them
forth upon the world.
</p>

<p>
Let us see these Moslems at work in the
countries that they conquered.  Mohammed
himself was far more than a warrior,
or even than a ruler&mdash;first and foremost, he
had stood forth as the <i>Prophet</i>.  And we
shall never understand Islam if we regard
it only as a battle-cry.  The task which
Islam set itself was more than the conquest
of the nations.  That might have left them
Zoroastrian or Pagan, Jew or Christian
still.  Its task was not merely to defeat
armies, but to <i>proclaim a creed</i> and win
adherents to it.  Therefore, as the Caliph's
armies marched, conquering province after
province, the inhabitants were summoned
to declare their faith in Islam and to
repeat the creed.

<p>
The <i>Korân</i> was set up as the law of
the land, governing, besides questions of
morality and religious ritual, all matters of
politics, and government, and administration;
and taxation, economy, and criminal
and civil law.  <i>Mosques</i> were quickly built
in every city, from which the call to prayer
sounded five times daily.  Within a day or
two of the capture of Jerusalem, Omar, the
second Caliph, laid the foundation stone of
the 'Mosque of Omar' upon the rock of
Mount Zion.  This mosque to-day marks
the Moslem's possession of one of the most
sacred spots of historic Christianity.
<i>Moslem governors</i>, or viziers, were appointed to
each province to carry out the policy of the
Caliph and to collect the tribute for him.
<i>Teachers</i> were sent to every country to
instruct the people in the Korân and in the
observances of the new Faith.  <i>Magistrates</i>
were ordered to insist that all, whether old
or young, were regular in their attendance
at public prayer on Fridays, and to see to
the observance of the Fast of Ramadân.
</p>

<p>
The 'conversion' of simple pagan tribes
under such conditions was an easy matter.
The Zoroastrians of Persia were, for the
most part, readily won.  The invasion of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P109"></a>109}</span>
Christian states came at the time when
faith was at a low ebb.  Indeed, the one
only worthy object of faith was almost
hidden by false teaching.  Therefore the
Church's grip was weak.  In Africa, in
Arabia, in Mesopotamia, in Egypt, in Syria,
and, afterwards, in Spain, whole tribes or
local states abandoned Christianity for the
new Faith, and even joined the ranks of
the Moslem army.
</p>

<p>
Here and there small Christian states
and Churches stood bravely against the
rushing tide, like lonely fortresses amid a
surging, hostile sea.  But the old and
illustrious Mediterranean citadels of the
Christian faith&mdash;Carthage, Alexandria,
Jerusalem, Antioch, and Constantinople&mdash;fell
into the hands of the Moslems, and
Christendom fell back to build her capitals
anew on the Atlantic shores&mdash;in Gaul,
Germany, Britain, and Scandinavia.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Treatment of Jews and Christians.
</span>
</p>

<p>
In their administration of these
conquered provinces the Moslems displayed
some measure of good sense and humanity,
though Christians and Jews who refused
to become Moslems were by the Korân
ordered 'to be brought low by the sword.'  They
paid tribute, and received in return
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P110"></a>110}</span>
the protection of the Islamic state for
themselves and for their churches.[<a id="chap07fn2text"></a><a href="#chap07fn2">2</a>]  In
most provinces Christians were, however,
debarred from holding civil office,
everywhere they were forbidden to make
converts, and Islam then, as, indeed, in many
countries to-day, punished with death those
who turned from the Prophet to Christ.
Conditions changed with the times, and
with the character of the Caliph in power.
Seldom, however, were Christians left quite
unmolested by the Mohammedans around;
vexatious and humiliating conditions were
imposed upon them, increasing more and
more as time went on; pressure of many
sorts was brought to bear upon them.  For
instance, 'Bokhara struggled desperately
against the new Faith, and every Bokharan
was compelled to share his dwelling
with a Moslem Arab, and those who
prayed and fasted like good Moslems were
rewarded with money.'  The position taken
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P111"></a>111}</span>
by the Moslem conquerors was one which
offered many material enticements to those
who wavered in their allegiance to the
Gospel, and, as we have said, Islam never
cared about a man's motives.  Above all,
there was the force and pressure of such a
strong current of opinion, of conviction,
of numbers, of obvious success, as has no
parallel in history.  Had not even
Jerusalem fallen to the new religion?
</p>

<p>
Within a century of the Hegira, the
Caliphs of Islam were not only undisputed
rulers of the greatest empire the world
has ever seen, but the heads of a religion
numbering many million followers.  Truly,
they could say, the world was at their feet.
The wealth of Asia, of Africa, of Europe
poured into their treasury.  The court of
the Caliphs, first at Damascus, and then at
Baghdad, was one of the most magnificent
and lavish in history.  Within 150 years
of the Hegira, Islam had reached the zenith
of its power.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Rule of the Caliphs of Baghdad.
</span>
</p>

<p>
The Caliphs of Baghdad especially gave
their patronage to science, literature, and
art; men of learning gathered round them;
not only Arabian and Persian literature
was exploited, but the sages of the Greeks
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P112"></a>112}</span>
were translated into Arabic, and splendid
libraries were collected.  Scholars and
talented translators and scribes were held
in high honour.  'The ink of the doctor
is equally valuable with the blood of the
martyr,' it was said.  While Byzantium
suppressed medicine, Baghdad cultivated
it.  The foundation of the science of
modern chemistry may be said to have
been laid there by the discovery of the
acids.  A great college was founded and
endowed in Baghdad, where it is said 6000
students, from the son of the noble to the
son of the mechanic, were taught; and
instruction was given in mathematics,
astronomy, chemistry, alchemy, law, and
medicine.  Nor was it in the capital only
that a new impetus was given to learning,
the sciences, and art.  One Caliph made a
law that, wherever a mosque was built, a
school should be founded beside it, and
colleges and schools sprang up in the
bigger cities of the empire.  Spain formed
a library of 600,000 volumes, and bears
marks to-day of Moslem vigour, taste, and
influence in what is still spoken of as
'Moorish architecture.'
</p>

<p>
But at the same time it should be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P113"></a>113}</span>
remembered that both at Baghdad and
in Spain the advocates of learning were
'rationalists,' not orthodox Moslems.
</p>

<p>
The story of the magnificent pomp of
the Caliphs of Baghdad in the days of its
tawdry glory reads like the fairy picture
of another world.  Barges and boats of
the most superb decoration floated on the
Tigris.  A tree of gold and silver stood
before the palace, upon whose eighteen
branches sat birds fashioned with precious
stones.  The walls of the palace were
hung with 38,000 pieces of tapestry, a
great number of which were of silk,
embroidered with gold.  The costly carpets
on the floors were 12,000.  The Caliph
was surrounded by state officers and slaves.
Wives, concubines, and eunuchs to the
number of several thousand attended on
his person.  When he took the field he
was guarded by 12,000 horsemen whose
belts and scimitars were studded with
gold.

<p>
We open our eyes again in these early
years of the twentieth century, when the
history of a thousand years has been written,
to see whereto this thing has grown, and
what its achievements on behalf of
mankind.  The religion of Islam has more
adherents than it had; its dominion is
marked by three Moslem empires: Turkey,
Persia, and Morocco; it is the religion of
Arabia still; its followers predominate in
Egypt, in Asia Minor, in Afghanistan,
in the East Indies.  It numbers many
millions throughout Africa, India, China,
Russia, and the Philippines; but nowhere,
unless it be possibly in some of the most
degraded districts of pagan Africa, do
Moslems stand above their fellows in
enlightenment, in morality, in progress.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P115"></a>115}</span>
Has Islam, then, failed to meet men?  No,
it has touched man, indeed, in some of the
deeper regions of his consciousness.  But
it has met men on their own level, and so
it has left them where they were.  Why?  How?

CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
ISLAM'S FAILURE
</h3>

<p class="intro">
'As we conceive God, we conceive the Universe;
a being incapable of loving is incapable of being
loved.'&mdash;PRINCIPAL FAIRBAIRN.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Another View of Baghdad.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Before we set ourselves such questions as
these, we should, perhaps, have peered a
little more closely into the Caliph's palace.
We might have gone round to the back
door, and not to the front; we might (at
the risk of our lives, though!) have watched
him in his private life.  We might have
had an interview (if we could summon up
the courage) with his ever-ready staff of
state executioners, whose work was carried
out at his caprice and not at the dictates
of imperial justice, and have heard the tale
of banquets where all the guests were
murdered.  We might have discovered in
what fear he lived, how perilous a throne
was his.  Of the fifty-nine Caliphs of
Baghdad, thirty-eight met violent deaths.
We might have heard the confession of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
Caliph Abdalrahman, who reigned for the
record period of fifty years, perhaps the
most splendid of all the line:
</p>

<p>
'I have now reigned above fifty years in
victory and peace, beloved of my subjects,
dreaded by my enemies, and respected by
my allies.  Riches and honours, power and
pleasure have waited on my call, nor does
any earthly blessing appear to have been
wanting to my felicity.  In this situation
I have diligently numbered the days of
pure and genuine happiness which have
fallen to my lot; they amount to fourteen.
O man!  Place not thy confidence in this
present world.'[<a id="chap08fn1text"></a><a href="#chap08fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
We might have discovered that the
physicians, scientists, metaphysicians, and
'literati,' who, to their credit, the Caliphs
drew around them, were not Moslems, but
Greeks, Jews, and Persians, and even that
the most enlightened of the Caliphs, heads
of the religion of the Prophet, were not
Mohammedans in heart, but infidels.
There was much food for thought there.
</p>

<p>
However, without lingering any longer
about the precincts of the Court of Baghdad,
we will pursue our inquiry, asking, with all
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P118"></a>118}</span>
seriousness, what, all down the centuries,
have been the marks of Islam upon the
countries it has conquered?  What have
been its fruits among the nations that
adopted Islam as their faith?  What are
the fruits of Islam to-day?
</p>

<p>
We stand upon a pinnacle of 1200
years, looking out upon the world, and
looking back upon the history of twelve
centuries of Islam.  Can we not find some
features, so common that we may call
them <i>characteristic features</i>, of
Mohammedanism, which will help us in forming
an estimate of the influence of Islam upon
mankind?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Fruits of Islam.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Let us then try to bring Islam to the
test, as we are able to examine its influence
in this twentieth century.  For after all
the ultimate test of a religion must be its
continuous fitness to elevate the faith and
character of man.
</p>

<p>
Let us take, to begin with, the estimate
not of a missionary enthusiast, but of a
deliberately unbiassed writer in a secular
magazine.[<a id="chap08fn2text"></a><a href="#chap08fn2">2</a>]  Discussing the situation in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P119"></a>119}</span>
those countries where 'Islam has had a
free hand,' he says:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
'For centuries it had had a fair field for developing
its principles and exhibiting its spirit under
the most favourable circumstances of climate, soil,
natural resources, geographical position, together
with a variety of races, unsurpassed in Christendom
in all the qualities which go to the making of capable
citizens....  And what is the result?  Barbarism,
oppression, lawlessness, corruption, cruelty,
ignorance, decadence, have settled like an incurable
blight on all the lands of Islam.  There is no
exception, not a single bright spot anywhere; no
green oasis in all that wilderness of savage
desolation.  And those lands were once fertile, populous
and flourishing homes of the arts, of science, and
of literature! ... What became of these rich and
civilized lands under Islam?  Let the degraded,
impoverished, and savage condition of Persia and
the Khanites of Central Asia answer.  Every vestige
has disappeared of their flourishing condition before
Islam invaded them.  It exterminated all alien
influences, gave free scope to its own spirit, and we
see the result.'
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
As it is not possible to cover the whole
field, let us take a closer look at the
three Moslem empires of to-day, where
Islam has for long years held undisputed sway.
</p>

<p>
First, then, let us see Islam in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P120"></a>120}</span>
Turkish Empire, ruling from Constantinople,
the successor of Baghdad.  What
is the story of the rule of the Moslem
there?  Again we will consult unprejudiced
witnesses.  Professor Freeman, the
historian, says of him:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
'His rule during all that time has been the rule
of cruelty, faithlessness, and brutal lust: it has not
been government, but organized brigandage....
While all other nations get better, the Turk gets
worse and worse.'[<a id="chap08fn3text"></a><a href="#chap08fn3">3</a>]
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Or again, Mr. Bosworth Smith, most
determined of apologists of Mohammed
and Mohammedanism, is forced to admit that
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quoteno">
'the system of government, never an enlightened
one, has, at all events since the so-called reforms
of the Sultan Mahmoud, been rotten at the core.
Stamboul has become an asylum for the rascality
of East and West alike; the finest peasantry in the
world, the inhabitants of Asia Minor, are dying by
starvation, partly, no doubt, owing to bad harvests,
but still more owing to the neglect of the most
ordinary precautions and duties of Government.
Roads unmade, bridges broken down, mines
unworked, unprincipled and exorbitant provincial
Pashas, wastefulness and disorder and excessive
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P121"></a>121}</span>
centralization&mdash;such is the picture which travellers
give us of these fair regions of the earth, and,
unfortunately, we know it to be a true picture.'[<a id="chap08fn4text"></a><a href="#chap08fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It was this same Sultan Mahmoud who
issued in 1827 a protest against the
interference of the Christian Powers in the
administration of the Turkish Empire,
'the affairs of which,' as he truly said,
'are conducted upon the principles of
sacred legislation, and all the regulations
of which are strictly connected with
the principles of religion.'  The unending
record of massacres, and of even more
vile atrocities perpetrated upon Armenian
Christians within that Empire are but
another witness to its degradation, and
are hardly past history yet.  The war has
brought us terrible reminders that the
Moslem is no less a Moslem for his German
alliance.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Persia.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Or if we turn to Persia, we find no relief
from the gloom into which a survey of the
history and condition of Moslem lands has
plunged us.  An observant traveller, after
a journey across Persia, thus describes its
condition:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P122"></a>122}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
Like a wreck, a ruin, a memory of far distant
greatness, the Persian nation lies in evidence of the
paralysis of Islam.  There are no schools, save here
and there chattering groups around a village priest,
or worse than medieval groups around a mesjid and
a mujtahid.  The few schools of the Government
in Tabriz and Teheran are chiefly opportunities for
officials to eat up public revenues.  Charitable
institutions are practically unknown.  Prisons are
mere places of torture until the demanded money
fine is paid.  Houses of permanent detention or
reformation for evil-doers do not exist.  Death or
payment or torture are the end of the law.  The
courts, half civil, half ecclesiastical, are irregular,
with no written codes, no jury system, no pleading,
no testimony, save the eloquence and evidence of
bribes.  The sects of Shiahism[<a id="chap08fn5text"></a><a href="#chap08fn5">5</a>] riot when they
please in internecine strife, plunder and murder.
The attempts to imitate some of the external ways
of civilization have ended in bathos.  The postal
system is a despair, the couriers lounging idly
along the road, taking often a week to go 200 miles,
while postmasters take letters from the mail when
they please, and are the tools of the Government.
The telegraph system is yet more of a farce.  Whole
sentences were omitted from our messages.  The
posts lie on the ground with the wires under the
feet of the caravans.  Telegrams are often as long
on the road as letters, and the senders frequently
arrive before their messages.  The roads are mere
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P123"></a>123}</span>
trails.  One or two were built once, but they are
falling into ruin....  The army, with wages of
two cents a day, and pay a year in arrears, tattered
and sickly, is too sad a sight to be ludicrous....
The land lies smitten and in despair....  Saddest
of all is the decadence of religious perception, the
want of moral stamina, the prevalence of deceit,
falsehood, rottenness of life, of all of which there is
no stronger evidence than the throngs of dervishes,
the holy men of Islam, who wander up and down
the land, loathsome beyond words.'[<a id="chap08fn6text"></a><a href="#chap08fn6">6</a>]

Of the third Mohammedan empire,
Morocco, let Hall Caine the novelist,
who on occasion can go great lengths as
the friend and flatterer of Islam, speak:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
'Within sight of an English port and within hail
of English ships, as they pass on to our Empire in
the East, there is a land where the ways of life are
the same to-day as they were a thousand years ago,
a land wherein government is oppression, wherein
law is tyranny, wherein justice is bought and sold,
wherein it is a terror to be rich and a danger to be
poor, wherein man may still be the slave of man,
and woman is no more than a creature of lust&mdash;a
reproach to Europe, a disgrace to the century, an
outrage on humanity, a blight on religion!  That
land is Morocco.'[<a id="chap08fn7text"></a><a href="#chap08fn7">7</a>]

visited that country:

<p class="quote">
'It was difficult to grasp the fact which has been

Among no people are prayers so commonly heard

side by side with it all, rapine and murder,
mendacity of the most advanced type, and brutish and
nameless vices exist to an extraordinary degree.
From the Sultan down to the loathsome beggar,
from the most learned to the most illiterate, from

Reaction of Moslem Degradation on other Lands.
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is facts such as these which give to
the problem of Islam its urgent and
insistent importance.  One-seventh of the
world is in its grip.  Humanity, after all,
is one great whole, and it is impossible for
some races to be in this decadent condition
and for all the others not to feel it.
Circulation goes on fast in this modern
world, with its railways, telegraphs, and
telephones, its greyhound 'liners' and its
aeroplanes; and the interaction of one
country on another is more quickly and
deeply felt.  What is happening in the
streets of Stamboul, and Teheran, and
Morocco, must inevitably affect us,
however unconsciously, in the streets of
London and Edinburgh.[<a id="chap08fn9text"></a><a href="#chap08fn9">9</a>]  Therefore, if
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P126"></a>126}</span>
only for selfish reasons, it is a problem
which concerns us.  Moreover, among the
subject races of the Empire over which we
rule, there are ninety and a half million
Moslems,[<a id="chap08fn10text"></a><a href="#chap08fn10">10</a>] and we have a duty to them
which we can never pay until we
understand them and have tried to face the
problem.

<p>
How is it, then, that a religion that
began with such earnestness, that was
propagated with such success, that so quickly
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P127"></a>127}</span>
reached such magnificent proportions, has
been as a blight upon the nations upon
which it fell?
</p>

<p>
We shall not satisfy ourselves unless
we carry our investigation back to the
source, to Mohammed and his teaching,
not this time, as in our last chapter, to
discover the cause of its success, but the
secret of its failure.
</p>

<p>
With this in mind we ask again, 'What
was the essence of Mohammed's teaching?'
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mohammed's teaching. 1. God.
</span>
</p>

<p>
I. <i>His teaching about God</i>.&mdash;There are
two qualities or attributes of Allah that
we have heard, in fancy, from a myriad
minarets all down thirteen long centuries,
proclaiming the Allah whom the Moslem
worships&mdash;'God is One,' and 'God is
Great.'  Those are the thoughts that call
the Moslem daily to worship, that make
for him his idea of God.  They tower
above, and almost overshadow, all else
that he knows of Him; they fill his mind
until God becomes to him but little more
than an unlovable and loveless despot.  He
is a God above him, but not with him, still
less with him and in him.  True, Moslem
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P128"></a>128}</span>
tradition teaches ninety-nine names of God,
but not one brings Him near, not one calls
Him Father.  'The Merciful' is again and
again used of Him in the Korân, but as we
listen more closely it is the mercy of a
despot, not of a loving Father, which it
proclaims, and there is <i>all</i> the difference.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, the Moslem's Allah is absolute
<i>Will</i>, neither bound nor directed by any
law of right or wrong, and in His dealings
with the world there is, there can be,
nothing moral.  'God,' we are told,
'misleadeth whom He willeth, and guideth
aright whom He willeth,'[<a id="chap08fn11text"></a><a href="#chap08fn11">11</a>] and, 'As for
man, we have firmly fixed his fate about
his neck.'[<a id="chap08fn12text"></a><a href="#chap08fn12">12</a>]  Therefore, to the Moslem there
can be no true sense of sin, for what his
conscience condemns may be the will of
Allah,[<a id="chap08fn13text"></a><a href="#chap08fn13">13</a>] and the only sin he can conceive is
to transgress an arbitrary degree of Allah's
pleasure, or deny his Prophet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P129"></a>129}</span>
</p>

<p>
Therefore, because Allah to the Moslem
is not a Father, because He is not Love, He
does not yearn for the love of men.
</p>

<p>
Because He is not holy, He does not
yearn for men to be Godlike, holy as
Himself.
</p>

<p>
So because He is not Love and Holiness,
He does not seek to redeem men from sin,
to draw them to Himself.
</p>

<p>
There is no bridge needed, no bridge
possible, no sacrifice, no 'wall of partition'
to be broken down, no Atonement, no
Calvary, no thought of God sharing our
life, that we may share His in holiness and
love through all eternity, no Incarnation.
</p>

<p>
It is as though the Allah of the Moslem
says, 'I have called you slaves'; not the
words of infinite love and infinite glory,
'I have called you friends.'  Islam denies,
in fact, those eternal truths in which man's
only hope of a redeemed life can lie&mdash;the
divine life of our Lord on earth and His
path through the Sacrifice of Himself, to
the glory of His resurrection.

2. Man and Woman. (a) Man.
</span>
</p>

<p>
II. <i>His teaching about Man</i>.&mdash;Because
the Moslem's view of God is out of focus,
discoloured, distorted, and false, therefore
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P130"></a>130}</span>
his view of man is false and out of focus
too.
</p>

<p>
If God is not our Father, then we
are not His children, and cannot be.  If
He is but an Almighty Despot, we can
only be His subjects, His slaves at best.
And the Korân gives man no better place
than that of the highest of the living
beings inhabiting the earth.  No breath
of God is in him, no spark that is divine.
And so it came about that during his life
Mohammed never taught men to think;
he gave not principles, but precepts, and
religion became a thing of ritual and not a
religion of the heart.  We have seen how
Islam in its propagation sought to win
men's allegiance and asked no questions as
to motives.  Its very religious observances
are not concerned with righteousness of
life.  For instance, in its teaching about
prayer the Korân contains the most
explicit instructions about the manner of
prayer, about the previous washing, about
the direction, the posture, the language,
the form, but there is hardly a word about
its meaning or its spirit.  'In the 10,000
verses of the Korân there are not as many
petitions as there are in the Lord's Prayer.'
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P131"></a>131}</span>
So completely do spirituality and
righteousness seem to have got divorced in the
Moslem mind, that there seems nothing
incongruous, at least to many Moslems,
in lying, cheating, swearing, and praying
almost in the same breath.[<a id="chap08fn14text"></a><a href="#chap08fn14">14</a>]
</p>

<p>
[Sidenote:
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pb"></a>b}</span>
Woman.]
</p>

<p>
It is not hard to understand that such
a God as Mohammed preached might be
conceived to make a distinction between
man and woman.  And the blackest of all
the blots which besmirch the name and
memory of Mohammed was his teaching
about Woman and his relations with her.
True, his teaching may have been in
advance of what was commonly accepted by
the Arabs of his day, but he left her still
the chattel and not the companion 'meet'
for man.  Women were to him an inferior
grade of beings, whose sole destiny was to
serve their husbands and be the mothers
of children.  Woman's honour, he said,
was not to be trusted.  He instituted the
veil (which women in Moslem lands wear
to this day to cover their faces whenever
they are in the presence of men) and
consigned her to the harem.  He gave 'divine'
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P132"></a>132}</span>
sanction to a Mohammedan to have four
wives and as many concubines as he could
afford, to beat them when they displeased
him, and divorce them if he wished.
</p>

<p>
We do not need to follow the horrible
details of Mohammed's own life, and the
story of how, breaking his own law after
Khadîjah's death, he had not four wives
but nine.  Instinctively we turn to a wholly
different picture, to the story of the Life
that gave Woman for ever her charter of
emancipation and her place of honour.
We see Him sitting weary on the side of
Jacob's well, listening to and telling the
sad story of a woman's sins; or accepting
the offering of an alabaster box of
ointment, very precious, which a woman broke
upon His feet; we see Him comforting the
sisters of Lazarus in the home at Bethany;
and Himself comforted upon the cross by
women braver than His Apostles.  Were
not women, too, the first to approach the
tomb in the early dawn of Easter morning?
Yes, something greater than the most
beautiful of sentiments is written there.
It has proved itself in history the secret of
national greatness.  For, as Dr. Fairbairn
says, 'A religion that does not purify the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P133"></a>133}</span>
home cannot regenerate the race; one that
depraves the home is certain to deprave
humanity.  Motherhood is to be sacred if
manhood is to be honourable.  Spoil the
wife of sanctity, and for the man the
sanctities of life have perished.  And so
it has been with Islam.'

3. Paradise.
</span>
</p>

<p>
III. <i>Teaching about Paradise</i>.&mdash;Every
religion has a Heaven&mdash;a goal of some
sort towards which the faithful slowly
wend their way across the earthly span of
human life.  Each has its own 'joy set
before' man, to nerve, inspire, and direct
him in his earthly course, a Heaven for
which he is being fitted, where he shall
reach the perfection of his life.  What,
then, was the Heaven that Mohammed
painted, towards which the Moslem sets
his face?
</p>

<p>
It was little different from a glorified
Arabia&mdash;a land where men still keep the
lower natures which were their bondage
here, where their cravings and baser
appetites and passions are satisfied.  That
is the Heaven where the Moslem would be;
no note of triumph for a hard-won victory
over self, no robes washed white of all
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P134"></a>134}</span>
defilement, no joyful service, for which
this life was but the probation, in the
presence of the King.

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Revelation without Redemption.
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is enough.  The causes of Islam's
failure lie not far below the surface.  To
lift the eyes of Arabia above its poor idols
was indeed something: it is something to
believe and bear that witness to one God in
an unbelieving world to-day.  But it is not
all, or nearly all.  'Dost thou believe in the
one God?'  'The devils also believe,' and
are devils still, although they 'tremble.'  A
'revelation' without a redemption must
for ever mock man.  It calls him to aspire,
but 'whither?'  It teaches him he has a
duty, but what?  As one of our great
administrators of a Moslem land has said:
'Islam may mean progress, but certainly
it is progress up a blind alley.'  Man can
only raise his ladder on this earth, and
though he climb a little, it will not reach
to Heaven.

[<a href="#chap08fn9text">9</a>] Whatever may be the rearrangement of the map
of Europe and Western Asia to which the Great War
will lead, it is clear already that the problem of Islam
will have assumed a new importance and a new
urgency.  For Moslem Turkey has been courted and
won in alliance by great European powers, and armed
and organized for their support.  It has already been
terribly proved that Germany feels herself unable to
curb the passions she has roused&mdash;witness the wholesale
massacre of Armenian Christian populations in the
Turkish Empire, of which Lord Bryce, speaking in
the House of Lords (on 6th October, 1915), said: 'It
would seem that three-fourths or four-fifths of the
whole nation has been wiped out.  There is no case in
history, certainly not since the time of Tamerlane, in
which any crime so hideous and upon so large a scale
has been recorded.'
</p>

<p class="footnote">
It is clear enough that for Germany, or for us, or
for any other nation, there is only one means ultimately
of making the Turk a healthy influence in the world
and a worthy member of the commonwealth of nations,
and that is to change his heart&mdash;which indeed is the
programme of the Christian Gospel.

<p>
If this book has carried its readers along
any distance at all they will have
recognized two facts: Islam's tremendous
power, not only as a sword, but as a
creed, and Islam's failure to lift nations
and men up to a higher life.
</p>

<p>
There is one truth yet which we must
face, and perhaps we shall see its meaning
best if we turn it into parable.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A Parable.
</span>
</p>

<p>
There was a great university once that
numbered many teachers and a myriad
scholars.  The teachers were, for the most
part, wise and good and apt to teach, but
the wisest would confess that there was
much he did not know, whole realms of
knowledge he had never seen.  Their teachings
varied very greatly; but most of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P137"></a>137}</span>
wisest and best agreed in foretelling a
Teacher to come, wiser and truer than
them all, teaching not as they from their
own little corners of the truth, but gathering
up, as it were, the light of their shaded
and coloured lanterns into the white light
of a glorious sun.  So they foretold Him,
and so He came.  And when He taught,
the scholars said: 'Did ever man speak
like this Man?' and as they read His life
they saw the Truth in practice.  Men were
no more just creatures of this earth: they
had come from God, and God had come
from Heaven to win them back to Himself.
</p>

<p>
The good and the wise teachers of the
university then no longer pointed on to
the One Who should come: rather they
took up His words and His life, taught
them and expounded them, and ever found
new meaning and new teaching there, and
pointed ever up to Him.
</p>

<p>
Till at last there arose another teacher,
who, learning something of what the Great
Teacher had taught, began to think that
because he knew a little he was all-wise&mdash;yes,
even wiser than He.  Men gathered
to listen to his teaching.  And what did he
proclaim?  Something of the truths of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P138"></a>138}</span>
the Great Teacher, with a difference.  And
what was that difference?  No thoughtful
man has ever yet been found to maintain
that his teaching was more sublime, <i>but it
was easier</i>.
</p>

<p>
Had the Great Teacher taught that
there was one God?  So did he&mdash;the later
teacher&mdash;but his God was more of a despot
than a Father.
</p>

<p>
Had the Great Teacher taught a Heaven
of spiritual life?  He promised a Heaven
too, but one of carnal pleasure.
</p>

<p>
Had the Great Teacher taught men to
worship in spirit and in truth?  He taught
prayer, but he added that a prayer at
Mecca was worth more than elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Had the Great Teacher taught men to
pray without ceasing?  He taught men to
pray five times a day.
</p>

<p>
Had the Great Teacher called men to
be pure in heart?  He made provision for
men unwilling to be pure.
</p>

<p>
Had the Great Teacher raised Woman's
position?  He gave her certain rights
over property, but no honour.
</p>

<p>
Had the Great Teacher sent his
followers out to preach the kingdom and
heal the sick?  He sent his followers on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P139"></a>139}</span>
a similar errand, by the method of raiding
caravans.
</p>

<p>
Had the Great Teacher taught men to
rule their bodies?  He only forbade his
followers to take strong drink.
</p>

<p>
The Great Teacher had bidden men,
'Love your enemies.'  He instituted a
brotherhood embracing 'believers.'
</p>

<p>
The Great Teacher had sought men's
hearts.  He was content with a confession
of belief.
</p>

<p>
The Great Teacher had taught principles.
He left precepts for the guidance
of his followers.
</p>

<p>
The Great Teacher had been tempted
as all men are tempted, but had never
faltered, never stumbled, never failed.
The later teacher claimed a 'divine'
indulgence for his sins.
</p>

<p>
The Great Teacher suffered and laid
down His life for men&mdash;the other decreed
that his dominion should be extended by
the sword.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Mohammed's Claim to supersede Christ.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Islam is the one religion which throws
down a challenge to the Gospel; others
came before and knew not the Christ.
Mohammed alone of all religious teachers
has measured himself beside the holy JESUS,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P140"></a>140}</span>
and, coming after Him, <i>claims to supersede
Him</i>.  That is Islam's challenge to the
Church of Christ to-day.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Crusades.
</span>
</p>

<p>
That challenge, if not in its full
meaning, at least in its terror, was a very
real and threatening thing to European
Christendom in its early centuries, when
Saracens and Turks had almost surrounded
the Mediterranean, had conquered
Spain, threatened France, sacked Moscow,
and held Damascus and Jerusalem,
Bethlehem, Nazareth, and Olivet.  And
Christendom took up the gauntlet.  If Islam
attested its right by its conquests, so then
would the Church.  And the Christian
countries of Europe poured forth their
earnest, ignorant rabble and the glory of
their chivalry, with crosses on their
sword-hilts, and banners with '<i>Dieu le veult</i>'
floating above them, to the Holy War,
to recover Jerusalem from the Turks.
Hundreds of thousands of the nobility and
yeomen of Europe laid down their lives
with a feverish zeal in each Crusade, and
a long and ghastly line of bones whitened
the roads through Hungary to the East.
</p>

<p>
The Crusades present at once one of
the grandest pictures of misguided zeal,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P141"></a>141}</span>
and one of the blackest crimes in history;
for they were the very denial of the
Gospel for which they contended, and the
arms of Christian knights were stained
with acts of barbarity and cruelty more
heathenish than those of their Turkish
foes.  Christendom was repulsed, fighting
with the Moslem weapon, and it seemed
to many as though the Church had tried
in vain her <i>only</i> weapon&mdash;the weapon of
force.  Popes there were, and monks and
priests, and those who should have been
the shepherds of the flock, yet none saw
that the Church had cast aside the one
method that never fails.
</p>

<p>
The Turks were true to their religion,
and were following the example and
teaching of Mohammed, when they took
the sword; the Crusaders claimed to be
followers of Him Who said, 'My kingdom
is not of this world, else would My servants
fight'; 'Love your enemies'; of Whose life
it is written that 'He went about doing
good,' and Whose disciples learnt and
learnt out their Master's lesson&mdash;'Love
never faileth.  The greatest of these is
love.'
</p>

<p>
Did we say <i>none</i> saw it?  Yes, there
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P142"></a>142}</span>
were just a few, a mere handful.  For
God never leaves Himself without witness.
But there was one&mdash;for all that history tells
us&mdash;who had the courage of his faith.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Raymund Lull.
</span>
</p>

<p>
The son of a Christian knight and noble
in the Spanish island of Majorca, Raymund
'is acknowledged by all writers on
the history of missions to be the main
connecting link between the apostles of
Northern Europe and the leaders who
followed the Reformation.'  Read the story
of the thirteenth century in Europe, and
realize the days in which he lived.  The
spirit of the Crusades is still alive, the
conflict between Islam and Christian
Europe is still raging.  Tales of knightly
purity shine out from a background of
gross sensuality, and hymns of devotion
are written in strange contrast to
Bacchanalian revel songs.  The world-power
of Rome is declining, the general state of
morals, even among popes and clergy, is
very low; superstition is rife.  The
Inquisition has just come into play.
</p>

<p>
Towering high above his day, like some
unexpected mountain peak soaring above
an unbroken land of stagnant marsh, stands
the figure of this man, Raymund Lull, who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P143"></a>143}</span>
dared to believe in love, to preach love,
to live love.
</p>

<p>

<p>
He was brought up in luxury and ease
amid the splendour of the Spanish court,
'popular in the world, a lover of pleasure
rather than a lover of God.'  'He had
everything this world could give him:
brilliant, versatile, splendidly successful;
knight, poet, musician, scholar, nobleman,
courtier, gallant.'  So, till he was in his
thirty-second year.  To him, then, there
came the vision of Christ crucified.  In
the light of that Cross the glories of this
world faded, and a new glory entered his
life.  The Turkish question lay heavy on his
soul; and, full of a great longing towards
the Turks, he desired to 'conquer' the
Holy Land.  But here was his proposal
which he boldly set forth to the astonished
Crusade-going, Turk-hating Church:

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
'I see many knights going to the Holy Land
beyond the seas, and thinking that they can acquire
it by force of arms; but in the end all are destroyed
before they attain that which they think to have.
<i>Whence it seems to me that the conquest of the Holy
Land ought not to be attempted except in the way in
which Thou and Thine Apostles acquired it, namely,
by love and prayers and the pouring out of tears and
blood.</i>'

This marvellous man was, indeed, a
missionary of the most up-to-date kind.
Nine years of preparation he gave himself,
mastering Arabic, studying and writing on
Christian philosophy, learning geography,

twentieth-century missionary study!  And
all this with scarcely a friend who believed
that his missionary call was anything more
than a piece of chimerical fanaticism!

friendly discussions with them, writing
Christian pamphlets for them, then standing
before the leaders of the Roman Church&mdash;popes
and kings and councils, lecturing
before universities on behalf of the Moslem
world and the new crusade of love,
alternately missionary and missionary
deputation!  Looking back over these
years, he said:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
'I had a wife and children; I was tolerably
rich; I led a secular life.  All these things I
cheerfully resigned for the sake of promoting the common
good and diffusing abroad the common faith.  I
learned Arabic.  I have several times gone abroad
to preach the Gospel to the Saracens.  I have, for
the sake of the faith, been cast into prison and
scourged.  I have laboured for forty-five years to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P145"></a>145}</span>
gain over the shepherds of the Church and the
princes of Europe to the common good of Christendom.
Now I am old and poor, but still I am intent
on the same object.  I will persevere in it till death,
if the Lord permits it.'
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Like some young man, full of the burning
fire of a fresh enthusiasm, he sets out
for Africa at the age of fifty-six.  Yet,
like that same young man, he is very
human.  And it seems to bring Lull
very near us when we read that at the
last, as his ship was about to cast loose
from Genoa, his courage fails and the ship
sails without him.  'The agony that his
soul was suffering oppressed his body, out
of measure even unto death, so much so
that his friends carried him away from a
second ship in which he had embarked,
certain that his life could not last out the
voyage.  News of yet a third ship was
brought, and he finally determined to push
forward.  From that moment, he tells us,
he "was a new man."'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
3. Death.
</span>
</p>

<p>
In North Africa he remains two years,
disputing, winning, shepherding; is
imprisoned, sentenced to death, and finally
banished.  But only to fresh labour.  Much
has yet to be filled in to the closing years
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P146"></a>146}</span>
of this long, hard life.  He is preaching
in Crete, he is exhorting Christians in
Armenia, he is back in Africa again, he is
shipwrecked on the coast of Italy, then
back again in Bugia, in North Africa, where
at last a raging mob drags him, like Stephen.
outside the city wall and stones him to
death on June 30th, 1315.

Comparison of Lull's Methods with those of the Crusaders.
</span>
</p>

<p>
We look back now across nearly twelve
centuries to that scene in North Africa:
the old, worn-out man preaching, striving,
agonizing, praying, loving to the last, stoned
by the hands of the Moslems he loved,
leaving behind him a few scattered converts
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P147"></a>147}</span>
here and there, a number of learned
treatises since gone out of date, a Church
still heedless of his call, and not one friend
to follow him.
</p>

<p>
Then we turn our eyes to the countries
on the other side of the Mediterranean, and
think again of the First Crusade, where
half a million men poured out their lives
to recover Jerusalem, only to have it
wrested from their hands again; or to the
Crusade of splendour led by Richard of
the Lion Heart to ignominious failure.
We think of the new 'machine' the
Church was then inventing for the heretic
and Turk&mdash;the Inquisition.  Who, then,
had found the better way?  Which was
the right path?  Which had found the
true solution of the problem of Islam?
Which had found the true answer to
Islam's challenge&mdash;dauntless Crusader,
arrogant Pope, or this man with the fire
and the devotion of a Crusader, but with a
brother's love for the Moslem?
</p>

<p>
We listen to him again to-day.  His message
has not gone out of date, and never will.
He has left us the motto of his life:
</p>

<p>
'HE WHO LOVES NOT, LIVES NOT, AND HE
WHO LIVES BY THE LIFE CAN NEVER DIE.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P148"></a>148}</span>
</p>

<p>
He might have lived in this twentieth
century when he wrote the following prayer
with which he closes one of his books:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
'Lord of heaven, Father of all times, when Thou
didst send Thy Son to take upon Him human
nature, He and His Apostles lived in outward peace
with Jews, Pharisees, and other men....  And
so, after Thy example, should Christians conduct
themselves to Moslems; but since that ardour of
devotion which glowed in Apostles and holy men of
old no longer inspires us, love and devotion through
almost all the world have grown cold, and, therefore,
do Christians expend their efforts far more in the
outward than in the spiritual conflict.'

CHAPTER X
<br><br>
THE WORLD OF ISLAM
</h3>

<p class="intro2">
  'The tide of things rolls forward, surge on surge,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bringing the blessed hour<br>
  When in Himself the God of Love shall merge<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The God of will and power.'<br>

<span class="sidenote">
The Fruit of Lull's Life.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Where was the fruit of Raymund Lull's
life, and the answer to his prayer?  His
call to the Christian Church fell on deaf
or unwilling ears, and his prayer seemed
to have been in vain.  He left no followers
in his Crusade of Love; none caught his
spirit or sought his task.  One or two
short, fitful efforts by men like Francis
Xavier and his earnest Jesuits, who stood
alone in love and piety, is all that we can
trace in the Church's history of the
survival of Lull's spirit and Lull's mission as
the long centuries pass on from the darkness
of the Middle Ages to the light of
modern times.
</p>

<p>
To find the fruit and the answer we
must take a leap of five centuries from
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P150"></a>150}</span>
the time of Raymund Lull's death, landing
in the opening years of the nineteenth
century.  The spirit of Raymund Lull
was now born anew in Christendom, and
the spirit of the new Crusade&mdash;the Crusade
of Love&mdash;was growing in the Church.
The Moslem needed something better
than he had!  The Moslem was worth
winning!  The Moslem was included in
the world to which the Church was bidden
to go!  The Church, the body of Christ,
could never be complete until the Turk
was won!
</p>

<p>
It would be slow work.  Then so much
the more reason for not wasting time!  It
was dangerous work.  What had that to
do with it?  It was difficult work.  Then
so much the more were brave hearts zealous
to share in it!
</p>

<p>
These thoughts came slowly and gradually
with compelling force to just a few
here and there as the years rolled on.
And the nineteenth century gave its long
thin line of knights to the new Crusade
of Love.  They were the advance guard
of the new army, and right bravely did
they do their work.  No Moslems wanted
them, no Government encouraged them,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P151"></a>151}</span>
few even protected them, most of the
great Moslem countries were shut and
barred and bolted against them.[<a id="chap10fn1text"></a><a href="#chap10fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
They took their lives in their hands,
they spent long years in study, they
mastered the hardest languages in the
world and harnessed them for the Gospel,
translating the Bible and providing
Christian literature.  They prayed open doors
that were closed, they quietly stole through
any that were ajar.  Some willingly laid
down their lives, more sacrificed their
health, all faced lives of apparent failure,
confident that in the end the cause of
love must triumph.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Spirit of Christ in the 19th Century.
</span>
</p>

<p>
This era of modern Moslem missions is
but another evidence, perhaps the strongest
of all, of the spirit to which, in this last
hundred years, most wonderful of all in
history, Christian men and women have
opened their hearts.
</p>

<p>
The spirit that stopped the slave trade,
that reformed our prisons, that regulated
our factories, that multiplied our hospitals,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P152"></a>152}</span>
that sent Livingstone to Africa, Coleridge
Patteson to the South Seas, and Selwyn to
New Zealand, that inspired Barnardo and
General Booth, that nerves thousands of
workers in the slums of our great cities, is
the same spirit that impels Christian
missionaries forth to the Moslem world to-day.
</p>

<p>
And what is this spirit?  May we not
dare to say that it is born of a new
understanding of a Life lived among the hills
and valleys of Galilee, and a Cross raised
on a lonely hill outside Jerusalem nineteen
centuries ago?  There, at the centre of
world-history, men learned to look up into
the face of God and say 'Our Father,' and
then look out upon mankind and call them
'brothers,' and gazing on that Cross see
there the World's Redemption, the Son
of God lifted up that He might draw all
men to Himself.  Every dark corner of
the earth, every place of pain and sickness,
every haunt of sin and shame, every
falsehood and every half-truth seen in that
light is but a challenge to the Christian, to
lift up Him Who is the Lord of Life and
Light and Glory, to catch His Spirit that
He may be once more incarnate in the Life
of His Church.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P153"></a>153}</span>
</p>

<p>
So it has been for very many of us in the
Great War.  It has seemed that so many
of the things He died for are at
stake&mdash;liberty and love and gentleness and the
sympathy that appreciates the aspirations
of other peoples.  And our men and women
too have gladly given their lives and
yielded of their best that the eternal things
might win through and that other generations
may live in a better world.
</p>

<p>
And when peace comes to us again, the
same call will be there&mdash;less strident but
no less urgent&mdash;summoning every true
man to give his life for the world's
cleansing, to follow as he may the great
Redeemer, who redeemed men by His
cross.  The ultimate test of Englishmen
will be those years of peace.  Will there
then be a great uprising to the truly holy
war of love and unselfish service and the
great adventure of the Cross&mdash;the war
against sin and injustice, against social
and national wrong, the war for love and
truth and purity and the kingdom of
Jesus Christ?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Awakening of the East.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile in these opening years of the
twentieth century, away in the Far East
nations great and ancient are awakening to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P154"></a>154}</span>
take part in the life of the world.  The
Renaissance of Europe in the fifteenth century
is dwarfed by the Renaissance of Asia
to-day.  Japan has claimed a place beside
the European peoples in the comity of
nations, and has justified her claim.  China,
awakening from the sleep of ages, claims
it too.  India&mdash;our own Empire, torn by
dissensions under many masters in the
past&mdash;is in the throes of upheaval and
unrest.  This rising national spirit in the
heart of the Eastern nations, of China,
Japan, Korea, and India, is a challenge
to Christendom.  But it is far more.  With
its lofty, national aspirations it offers to
the Church of Christ a greater opportunity
than any in history.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Problem of Islam.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Among all these insistent problems, the
problem of Islam is this: That in this
modern world of renaissance, reform, movement,
and progress, one-seventh of mankind
turns to one physical and spiritual centre,
a black stone in the Kaaba at Mecca, a
city of the past.  In that holy city,
alas! notorious the world over for its sin and
wickedness,[<a id="chap10fn2text"></a><a href="#chap10fn2">2</a>] pilgrims meet from half the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P155"></a>155}</span>
races of the earth&mdash;Tartars and Malays,
Russians and Negroes, Indians and Chinese,
Arabs, Afghans, Persians, Egyptians, and
many more.  All this crowd of races,
peoples, nationalities, and tongues own one
Faith.  For all, the limit of aspiration, of
morals, of spirituality, was cast hard, fast,
unchangeable, in the life of the Prophet
and his book in the sixth century of Arabia.
</p>

<p>
From the far-off Celebes Islands in the
East to Rio de Oro, on the Atlantic shore of
Africa; from Russia, even from European
Russia, in the North down to the British
Protectorates of South Africa, that huge
Moslem world spreads out like some great
octopus, and its peoples turn themselves
inwards, westwards, eastwards, southwards,
northwards, as they prostrate themselves
in prayer towards Mecca, the historic
centre of the Faith.[<a id="chap10fn3text"></a><a href="#chap10fn3">3</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
East Indies.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Away in the furthest East the muezzin
ushers in the new world's day in the great
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P156"></a>156}</span>
luxuriant islands of the East Indies, where,
whilst Europe was occupied with the
Reformation, Mohammedan traders settled
among the simple pagans, winning them
to Islam.  To-day, in the islands of
Celebes, Borneo, Sumatra, Java, and the
Straits Settlements, thirty million Moslems
of Malay race recite with one accord the
creed of Allah and His Prophet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
China.
</span>
</p>

<p>
A few hours later, in the western
provinces of China, eight million Moslems are
summoned from sleep to prayer.  These
Chinese Moslems have never been under
Moslem rule, nor are they by any means
the fanatics we have got to know so well
in lands where Islam holds undisputed
sway.  They are Chinese first and Moslems
after, wearing the queue, concurring in
many Confucian rites, and joining in
ancestral worship, a witness to the power of
Islam where it never drew sword or held
the sceptre.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
India.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Hear, next, the voice of India's
sixty-six million Moslems, who, amid the
confusion of worship of countless idols,
acknowledge with no uncertain sound the
one God and His Prophet, and in stately
mosque and crowded bazaar and lonely
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P157"></a>157}</span>
field spread themselves in prayer towards
the sacred city.  These Moslems[<a id="chap10fn4text"></a><a href="#chap10fn4">4</a>] are
successors of the great warriors who ruled
and conquered India through a thousand
years&mdash;men like Mohammed Kasim
(711 A.D.), Mahmoud of Ghazni (1019 A.D.),
Jenghis Khan (1221 A.D.), Timur (1398
A.D.), and Mogul rulers, such as Akbar,
Shah Jehan, and Aurungzeb.  They are
among the most loyal of our British
fellow-subjects, but have never stood in India for
the cause of enlightenment or progress
up to the present time.  They are in
the mass far more illiterate than their
Hindu compatriots; they are in an undue
minority in the schools.  The Moslem
farmer is thriftless, and in debt to the
Hindu money-lender.  The Mohammedan
population stolidly oppose all the efforts of
the Government to stay the ravages of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P158"></a>158}</span>
bubonic plague.  Purity in the home and
personal life is more rare than among
Hindus.  Five times a day the muezzin
calls one-fifth of India to recite the
creed&mdash;the creed without a Saviour.

</p>

<p>
Through the great historic passes of the
North Indian mountains file down to-day
the Afghans and Baluchis, warriors by
nature, but in the Pax Britannica
merchants with their caravans.  These wild
and warlike people in their mountain
fastnesses know none other than Mohammed,
consecrate their matchlocks to his
service, and ask the blessing of Allah on
their raids.  In these rocky uplands every
man prays Meccaward, and the dead face
Mecca in their graves.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Central Asia.
</span>
</p>

<p>
On, into Central Asia, that great table-land,
'the roof of the world,' where three
empires meet.  In Bokhara, a centre of
Moslem influence and learning for all
Central Asia, and in Turkestan, almost
wholly Moslem, the faithful spread their
prayer-mats towards the south.
</p>

<p>
We are on the borders of Europe now,
but not at the limit of Islam.  Among the
scattered peoples of the 'Steppes' and
beyond in Europe to the very boundary of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P159"></a>159}</span>
Siberia, 'where the winter day is so short
that the Moslem can hardly find time to
pray all his stated prayers,' still the Prophet
of Arabia is acclaimed by eighteen million
Moslems scattered among a nominally
Christian people.  The voices of those
who in this vast tract worship JESUS rise
but faintly to our ears.
</p>

<p>
Westward again: and we stand in the
vast land of Persia, among the ruins of
world-empire, once the home of the
worshippers of the sun, and of the hosts of
heaven.  Persia now turns its back to the
rising sun and its face towards Mecca.
The Shah, the officers of state, the law, the
people, are Moslem, and have been for
twelve centuries; in Persia, as in Arabia,
the great closed land, Islam has reigned
alone.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Turkish Empire.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Across the Euphrates Valley, past the
cities of Babylon and Nineveh, whose
names are the only relics of their former
greatness, and we stand among the Moslem
countries bordering the Mediterranean
on the north-east, ruled with iron hand
according to Korânic Law by the Sultan
of Turkey, from Constantinople, the
queenly city of the Golden Horn, political
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P160"></a>160}</span>
centre of the Moslem world.  Here, in
Asia Minor and Syria, in the historic
cities where the Apostle of the Gentiles
loved, prayed, laboured, and suffered, and
in which he planted Christian Churches,
the muezzin's voice is heard to-day.
Great Moslem populations proclaiming
their simple, confident creed almost drown
the feeble praise of the few dispirited
Christians, remnant of Churches that have been.
</p>

<p>
Palestine, now swept within the Turkish
Empire, re-echoes the hard rasp of the
Moslem creed and shrinks beneath the
pressure of the Moslem heel.  Strange
that within the Empire of the Turk,
the Empire which in the past has stood
for oppression and persecution, should lie
the land that once cradled the Saviour
of the world.  Stranger still and far
more tragic, that on the hills which
JESUS trod, around the lake He loved, and
in the villages which heard His words of
Life and Light and Truth, His Name is
almost forgotten, dishonoured by the name
that denies His claim.

<p>
Africa lies before us, the land of trackless

</p>

<p>
It is the continent of pagan races,
negro and Bantu crowding in mud-built
towns or scattered in countless villages on
the river banks.  No stately temples of
sculptured marble enshrine their pagan
gods; weird sacred trees, fetishes, sacred
stones take their place.
</p>

<p>
The pagan continent&mdash;is it so indeed?
What means, then, the muezzin call from
Cape to Cairo, from Lagos to Zanzibar?
Whence come fanatic Moslems facing
eastward and northward in the old
strongholds of Christian Churches in North
Africa and Egypt, in the heart of the
Sahara, in the great, walled cities of Sokoto,
in the vast bush lands of West Africa,
where Moslem mosque and pagan temple
are side by side?  Down through central,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P162"></a>162}</span>
pagan Africa, the land where Livingstone's
heart still lies, we find the Moslem convert
where ten years ago Mohammed was not
known.  Pagan Africa! its paganism fades
into the past, and it fades before the
crescent, not the Cross.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Urgent Problems.
</span>
</p>

<p>
That is the problem of Africa, and it is
the problem of today.  What is to be the
future of this great continent?  The land is
in trust to the powers of Europe, Christian
by name.  They must decide its fate.  Is
the simple, laughing savage, clinging so
feebly to his poor superstition, to be
gripped by the iron hand of this Islam
we have studied, or shall his feet be set
upon the path which has no limit but the
purity, the love, the holiness of God?
Twelve centuries ago the Christian citadels
of North Africa were wrested from the
Christian Church and they have never
been recovered.  Islam has rolled across
the great Soudan and in the last fifty
years has broken through into the Southern
Continent.  In the last ten years it has
spread down the Niger river, passing little
Christian churches on the way, across the
old West African Protectorates, and out
to the sea, building its tiny mosques in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P163"></a>163}</span>
heathen villages, teaching its short, simple
creed, steeling the African against the
Gospel.[<a id="chap10fn5text"></a><a href="#chap10fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p>
One-third of Africa is Moslem.  The
next twenty-five years must largely decide
the fate of the rest.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Moslem Propaganda in Africa.
</span>
</p>

<p>
How has it come to pass?  Not by the
sword, for Europe has ordered the sword
to be sheathed.  Not by the prestige of
Moslem government, for the great bulk
of Africa is under European rule, which
professes to treat all religions alike.
</p>

<p>
The Moslem trader, confident, earnest,
and proud, sitting at rest in the market
of a neighbouring village, on the long
march of a caravan, on the ship that bears
him up and down the Nile, in the streets
of the great coast towns, boldly
acknowledges Allah and His Prophet.  He feels
no qualms for any inconsistency in his life,
nor is his message weakened thereby.
The simple pagan, whose ancient
superstitions are already rudely shattered by
advancing civilization, eagerly grasps at
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P164"></a>164}</span>
a creed so simple and so apparently
complete.  He knows it offers him a
brotherhood and a social status he never
dreamt of before.  The meagreness of
Islam's demands makes conversion easy.
He need make but small change in the
manner of his life, while, instead of the
haunting dread of a world full of evil
and evil-meaning spirits, comes the great

<p>
Traders or warriors, there is something
great about these Moslems.  There is a
fine picture by Sir Reginald Wingate of
Abdurahman Wad en Nejumi, his noblest
enemy who fought under the Mahdi in the
Eastern Soudan:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
'He was a Jaali, one of the not very numerous
tribe of Jaalin, but one in whom the Baggara
recognized warlike qualities similar to their own,
and with whom it was important to keep on good
terms.  In early life, a Fiki, like the Mahdi, and
his devoted friend, stern, hard, ascetic, the thin,
dark man was the incarnation of a blind sincerity
of conviction.  He never transgressed the
self-appointed strictures with which he ruled his
conduct.  Withal, a spice of madness entered into
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P165"></a>165}</span>
his composition.  There was no man but trusted
his word, and his the distant enterprise, his the
forefront of danger always was.  Mahdiism was the
natural outlet for his wild temper.  He was the
Khâlid of the Prophet's wars.  He it was who
prepared the stratagem which annihilated Hicks.
He it was who crept silently round through the
shallow mud beyond the crumbled ramparts of
Khartoum.  In him was realized the phrase, unique
in consular dispatch, "They are so fond of the
Mahdi, one may say that they are the body, and he
the soul."'
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And this of Wad en Nejumi's death a
few years later:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
'All fighting appeared over, when a camel laden
with what was at first supposed to be a gun was
observed along the line of retreat, surrounded by
some forty men.  This party, on being observed,
was fired on by a troop of cavalry; the camel fell
and most of the men appeared to have been killed;
the cavalry then followed up, and called upon the
remainder to surrender, but as they approached, the
Arabs supposed to have been killed suddenly sprang
up, and rushing at them, a hand-to-hand encounter
ensued; a number were killed, and the remainder
returned once more to their camel.  They were
again called upon to surrender, but their only
response was a second charge, which resulted in all
being killed except one, who, mounting a passing
horse, succeeded in escaping.  The cavalry finding
no gun on the camel, as they expected, continued
the pursuit, but it was subsequently discovered that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P166"></a>166}</span>
the camel had been carrying the dead body of an
important chief, and under the direction of Captain
Macdonald it was sent to Toski, where it was at
once identified by all the captives as that of
Nejumi.  It eventually transpired that, being
severely wounded, he was being carefully tended by
his bodyguard, who, placing him on a rough camel
litter, had attempted to convey him to the rear.
One of his sons, a boy of five years old, was found
dead beside the camel, while another baby boy,
scarcely a year old, was brought by his nurse into
the camp at Toski on the following day.'[<a id="chap10fn6text"></a><a href="#chap10fn6">6</a>]

We dare to admire him.  Can we not
sever the man from the system and learn
to love him too?
</p>

<p>
That is the paradox of Islam&mdash;the hateful
system, and the rough, natural, earnest,
lovable man.  How shall the Church of

in these opening years of the twentieth

ISLAM AND THE CHURCH OF CHRIST

<span class="sidenote">
Livingstone and Stanley.
</span>
</p>

<p>
On November 10, 1871, two men met in
the heart of Africa.  One, David Livingstone,
intrepid missionary and explorer, had
been lost, and reputed dead for years.  The
other, Henry Stanley, after long months
of heroic search, found the 'white man with
hair on his face' within sound of the
thunderous surf on the shores of Lake
Tanganyika, and greeted him with,
'Dr. Livingstone, I presume?'
</p>

<p>
The day of that meeting is one of the
most significant dates in Africa's history.
Stanley returned home to rouse Europe.
Livingstone, worn and weakened by illness,
remained.  At Ilala, a year after Stanley
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P169"></a>169}</span>
left him, his faithful African boys found
'the great master' kneeling by his bedside,
dead.
</p>

<p>
The life and death of Livingstone is said
to have inspired the founding of twenty-two
Missionary Societies.  Certainly it
opened a new chapter in the story of
African Missions.
</p>

<p>
The ears of Europe rang with the tales of
Livingstone and Stanley, and the heart of
Europe responded to their appeal to heal
that great open sore, the slave trade.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Slave Trade.
</span>
</p>

<p>
And who were the slave traders?  Our
friends the Moslem Arabs.  But Stanley and
Livingstone, standing in the heart of that
Dark Continent, saw plainly enough that
something else was needed to lighten the
darkness than even the most vigorous
suppression of the Slave Trade and its
attendant atrocities.  Superstition, misery,
degradation, cruelty, were everywhere.
And as for the Moslems, pouring in from
the north in peaceful caravan or devastating
slave raid, they were making the situation
tenfold worse in every way than it was.
It was evident that no healing of Africa's
sores could come from them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Call to the Church.
</span>
</p>

<p>
In a famous despatch published in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P170"></a>170}</span>
<i>Daily Telegraph</i>, on November 15, 1875,
Stanley challenged the Church of Christ
to plunge boldly into the heart of Africa,
and make the countries of the still pagan
tribes south of the Great Lakes centres of
light for the whole Dark Continent.  The
challenge was accepted and the implied
prophecy has come true.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Missions in Central Africa.
</span>
</p>

<p>
The Universities' Mission to Central
Africa (founded in response to an earlier
appeal from Livingstone) has built its
cathedral at Zanzibar, on the site of the
old slave market, and its work has spread
inwards through Nyassaland.
</p>

<p>
The Livingstonia Mission, founded by
the Free Church of Scotland after
Livingstone's death, has, in a short space
of twenty years, seen wild, warlike tribes,
whose chief concern was warfare and
slaughter, settle down into hard-working
Christian communities.
</p>

<p>
In Uganda, the Mission founded by the
Church Missionary Society a little later,
has seen the growth of a Church of 98,000
Native Christians supporting its own 3,000
Native Christian workers and sending its
own missionaries into the heathen countries
around.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P171"></a>171}</span>
</p>

<p>
But in each place they were only just in
time; and other regions which were not
occupied, the Moslem is winning to-day.
Thirty years before Livingstone's death,
the great German Krapf, working for the
Church Missionary Society, had seen the
danger, and had challenged the Church to
forge a chain of Mission stations from east
to west to bind the Moslem to the north.
</p>

<p>
Many links of that chain have not yet
been forged, and the Moslem has streamed
down into the Southern Continent till there
is hardly a section of Africa in which he
may not be found.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Niger and Hausa Land.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Away in the West in the vast Niger districts
the same unequal race is going on,
but Christendom was later in the field.  In
1899, before our British troops had subdued
the Hausa states, a little party led by
Bishop Tugwell had penetrated 700 miles,
even up to Kano.  Here the Moslem ruled
the land and brooked no interference with
his raiding or his slavery.  He was engaged
in bringing the simple unorganized pagan
tribes to heel.  Christian missionaries
were the last people he wanted.  For
many months the little defenceless party
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P172"></a>172}</span>
found no rest for the soles of their feet.
If they pitched their tent they were quickly
ordered to remove it, the alternative being
the executioner's sword.  At last, in a
little village, they pitched their camp in
simple faith among a people of whom not
one but wished them gone.  Death, and
the many fevers of West Africa have
worked sad havoc in their ranks, but
bravely they kept on, though often one
man alone 'held the fort' in Gierku.
</p>

<p>
A language to be learned and reduced to
Roman writing, the Bible to be translated,
the suspicions of a hostile people to be
allayed, the very <i>meaning</i> of the words
truth and purity to be taught, learned
Moslem Mallams[<a id="chap11fn1text"></a><a href="#chap11fn1">1</a>] to be dealt with, men
and women, boys and girls, in a bondage
to sin, such as we have never thought of
in Europe, to be led out into the liberty
with which Christ alone makes free&mdash;that
was the task before them.
</p>

<p>
That was ten years ago: what is found
to-day?

<span class="sidenote">
A Hausa Convert.
</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
'Last summer a Hausa convert, only one year
after his baptism, was travelling, for business
purposes, to the old and fanatical city of Katsina, 140
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P173"></a>173}</span>
miles from our C. M. S. station in Zaria, almost the
earliest stronghold of Islam in this land.  He was
a young man of considerable ability and well known
for his learning; his conversion and baptism had
caused some consternation in orthodox circles,
where it had been freely said that whatever we
might succeed in doing among the illiterate, we
should never convert a <i>Mallam</i>!
</p>

<p class="quote">
'Soon after his arrival in Katsina, he was sent
for by the Emir, who said to him, "We have heard
of you, and your reputation has reached here.
Why did you leave your own faith and that of your
fathers, and become a Christian?"  Seeking for
God's guidance, our friend quietly gave his reasons,
and spoke of his joy and rest in Christ.  He then
asked permission to expound the Christian faith,
that those assembled (a few of the leading men,
including the chief religious Mohammedan official
and judge) might understand what he had received
in exchange for Islam.  This was permitted, and
for a long time he preached Christ to them.
</p>

<p class="quote">
'From that time, during the rest of his stay in
the city, not one day passed but he was invited to
the houses of the leading Mallams and chiefs, to
explain the Christian faith and read the Scriptures
in Arabic.  So the gospel was faithfully preached
to many in this city where no white missionary has
been allowed, by one who had been a learned
Mohammedan and whom Christ had saved.  This
same man and others are fearlessly proclaiming
Christ, and with ceaseless energy are seeking and
praying to bring in their fellow-countrymen to
the Light.'

<p>
The strength of Islam in Africa is
Egypt.  The great Moslem University of
Al Azhar 'is the centre, literally, from a
geographical, and actually from a spiritual
point of view of the world of Islam,'&mdash;a
Moslem University which exists to teach
the Moslem faith, with thousands of
students, and a training that often covers
twenty years, to which men come from
every outpost of the Moslem world.  'Far
the oldest of the medieval Universities, it
is the only one which has remained, and
remains, medieval in its curriculum, its
methods, its whole aspect'&mdash;such is the
head and heart of Islam to-day.
</p>

<p>
Shall this citadel of Islam be left
unassailed while the Church passes on to
easier work?  Or is it a challenge for
<i>picked men</i>, the best our Western learning
can produce, to outlearn the learned, to
love the hardest hearts and have patience
over wooden heads, to believe in spite of
all appearances that Truth is great and
will prevail?  To-day, through the many
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P175"></a>175}</span>
pillared porticoes into the great University
Court where for long centuries no Christian
could so much as enter, Christian missionaries,
true enough, men enough for this,
pass freely, welcome friends and visitors.
From this Moslem of Moslem Universities,
'students and ex-students have been
converted to Christianity, and not a few have,

Henry Martyn.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Just a hundred years ago Henry Martyn,
a young brilliant scholar, Senior Wrangler
of Cambridge, went out to India as a
Chaplain of the East India Company.  He
was only in India four years before he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P176"></a>176}</span>
moved on to Persia, but he left behind him
a translation, of the Bible into Hindustani.
His life was 'cut short,' as men said, at
thirty-one.
</p>

<p>
The fact of his going out at all was
staggering enough for intelligent men of
his day.  But when it transpired that his
purpose in taking the post was that he
might work among Hindus and Moslems,
they had no words to describe his action
but 'madness.'  'Absolutely throwing his
life away!' said some.  'Of all the
ridiculous ideas!' said others.  'Well, of all
the impossible tasks!' said the more
thoughtful, to whom, in those days, the
conversion of a Moslem to Christianity was
unimaginable.  Possibly if he had stayed
at home he might have lived to grey hairs,
a life of learning, wealth, and honour.
Instead, he planted a tiny living seed in
the field of Islam.  Was it worth while?
</p>

<p>
It is reported that he left in India
one, and only one, convert, Abdul Masih,
the keeper of the jewels at the Court of
Oudh.  He lived for fifteen years after
Martyn's death, labouring among his
Moslem compatriots, the first Mohammedan
ordained to the Christian ministry.

<p>
To-day among the native pastors and
Christian preachers and teachers in North
India, there are at least 200 who were once
followers of Islam.[<a id="chap11fn2text"></a><a href="#chap11fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p>
Let one speak for himself.  His name is
Moulvie Imad-ud-Din, he is a lineal
descendant of the famous Mohammedan saint,
Qutab Jamal, who traced his descent from
the ancient royal house of Persia: he was
born near Delhi, in 1830, and died at
Amritsar, in 1900.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
'When I was fifteen years of age, I left my
friends and relatives for my education, and went to
Agra, where my brother, Moulvie Karim-ud-Din,
was the Headmaster in the Urdu language.  I
remained there a long time under him....  As
soon as I had leisure from the study of science, I
began to wait on Fakirs and pious and learned men,
to discover the advantages of religion.  I frequented
the mosques and the houses set apart for religious
purposes, and the homes of the Moulvies and
carried on my studies in Mohammedan law, the
ceremonies of the Korân and the traditional sayings
of Mohammed, and also in manners, logic and
philosophy.  I knew nothing of the Christian
religion.  I had some doubts in my mind respecting
Mohammedanism in consequence of intercourse I had
had with some Christians, but the taunting curses
of the Moulvies and Mohammedans so confounded
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P178"></a>178}</span>
me that I quickly drew back from all such
thoughts....  I gave up all thought of disputation,
and controversy, and began to take great
pains in acquiring knowledge.  Without troubling
myself about any other concerns, I read steadily
night and day and continued doing so for eight or
ten years.
</p>

<p class="quote">
When the necessary attainments in the outward
knowledge of religion had been acquired, and
I had become brimful of Mohammedan bigotry from
it, I became entangled in another snare which the
learned Mohammedans have placed in the path of
the seeker after truth....  The Mohammedans
always at first, and for a long period of time, set
forth before enquirers the outward rites of their
law, and their bodily exercises and unprofitable
stories and the affinities of words used in their
controversies.  They then tie him by the leg with
a rope of deceit, in order to make him sit down
and rest contented, by telling him that what
he has already learned consists merely of the
outward ordinances of Mohammedanism, but that if
he wishes to prosecute his studies and investigate
the realities of religion he must go to the Fakirs
and the Mohammedan saints, and remain in attendance
on them for many years because they possess
the secret science of religion.
</p>

<p class="quote">
'As soon as I was entangled in this subtle science,
I began to practise speaking little, eating little,
living apart from men, afflicting my body and
keeping awake at nights.  I used to spend whole
nights reading the Korân.  I put in practice
... all the various special penances and devotions
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P179"></a>179}</span>
that were enjoined.  I used to shut my eyes and
sit in retirement, seeking by thinking on the Name
of God to write it on my heart.  I constantly sat
on the graves of holy men, in hopes that, by
contemplation, I might receive some revelation from
the tombs.  I went and sat in the assemblies of the
elders and hoped to receive grace by gazing with
great faith on the faces of the Sufies.  I used to go
even to the dreamy and intoxicated fanatics, in the
hope of thus attaining union with God.  And I did
all this, besides performing my prayers five times a
day, and also the prayer in the night and that in
the very early morning, and always was I repeating
the salutation of Mohammed and the confession
of faith....

'The thought of utterly renouncing the world then
came into my mind with so much power that I
left everybody and went into the jungles and

alone, without plan or baggage.

'In addition to the above I wrote the name of
God on paper 125,000 times, and I cut out each
word separately with scissors and wrapped them
up each in a little ball of flour and fed the fish

prescribed....

<p class="quote">
'I had got into the same state of mind that
many learned Mohammedans have been in under
similar circumstances.  I once had thought that
Mohammedanism was the best of all religions on
earth.  I had, therefore, believed Christianity to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P180"></a>180}</span>
be untrue: in short, I was a vehement opponent
of the Christian religion.  I therefore became
convinced in my own mind that all religions were
but vain fables, and that it was better for me to
live in ease and comfort myself, to act honestly
towards everybody, and to be satisfied with believing
in the unity of God.  For six years my mind
remained afflicted with these foolish thoughts....
</p>

<p class="quote">
'I came to Lahore.  I here heard of the
conversion to Christianity of Moulvie Safdar
Ali at Jubbulpore, which greatly amazed me
... gradually I remembered that Ali was a true and
just man, and I began to ask myself how he could
have acted in such a foolish manner as to leave the
Mohammedan religion.  I then thought that I
ought to begin to dispute with him by letter about
it.  With this object I procured the Old and
New Testaments and asked an English Christian
missionary to read the English Testament with
me.  When I read as far as the 7th Chapter of
St. Matthew, doubts fixed themselves upon my
mind respecting the truth of Mohammedanism.
I became so agitated that I spent whole days, and
often also whole nights, in reading and considering
the books, and began to speak about them both
with missionaries and Mohammedans.  Within a
year I had investigated the whole matter, chiefly
at nights, and I discovered that the religion of
Mohammed is not of God, and that Mohammedans
have been deceived, and that salvation is assuredly
to be found in the Christian religion.

<p class="quote">
'As soon as this had become evident to me, I
made everything known to my Mohammedan

angry; but some listened in my private chamber
to the proof I gave them.  They said quite plainly
that they knew that the religion of Mohammed
is not true; but they asked me what they could
do, when they were afraid of the opposition of
the world and of the reproaches and curses of
ignorant men.  In their hearts they said they
certainly believed Christianity to be true, and that
Mohammed could not be the Mediator of the
men of his religion, but they were unwilling to lose
the esteem of the world.  They urged me not to
make my faith public, but to call myself outwardly
a Mohammedan, and yet in my heart to believe in
Christianity....  The extent of their faith became
thus evident to me by their own confessions.  I
committed them all to God for, besides praying for
them, I knew not anything else I could do for
them, and I went myself to Amritsar and received
baptism.'

We have so far been meeting strong

a look at a very different Moslem whom we
meet in a Christian Hospital for women in
the heart of Persia.  The English lady
worker has just completed her round of the
wards, and we greet with her a former
out-patient, one of a group of women
converts.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
'The first of these was Sakîneh, who entered the
Women's Dispensary with her aunt, who was ill.
At that time Sakîneh was a bigoted Moslem, but
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P183"></a>183}</span>
gradually the message touched her heart.  A year
later she came for treatment for herself, her
husband's cruelty having made her ill, for which
reason he divorced her.  Sakîneh was then eager
to learn more of Christ's love.  Her father beat
her cruelly, but this seemed to increase her desire
for teaching....  She declared her faith in Jesus
as the only Saviour ... and was baptized.
Shortly after she began to try and tell her own family
and neighbours....  The news spread in her
village, Hoseinabad, that she was a Christian.  Then
a system of boycotting and persecution began.  Her
friends no longer saluted her in the streets, she was
pelted with mud and stones, hooted at, called infidel,
Nazarene, Christian dog, etc.  At the Public Baths a
woman noticed she had no Moslem charms on, and
charged her publicly with being a Christian.  At
first she was afraid to reply, then answered
"Yes."  At once she was cast out, and the place declared
defiled by her.  She was followed down the street
by an angry mob, and beaten with a chain used
for whipping donkeys....  Her fellow-villagers
declared either Sakîneh must be put to death or
she and her parents must leave the village.  As
night came on the mob surrounded the house,
threatening to take her life.  Her brother-in-law
got her over the wall of the village into the desert,
and brought her to our house.  Sakîneh was
unnerved, but kept on repeating, "I have not denied
Christ; I want to live and die a Christian."'

The Christian Church in Persia to-day.
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is a beautiful picture, and one full of
hope, that remains with us as we leave the
sad, inert, decadent land of Persia.  There
among a people, sinful, sensuous, corrupt,
and apparently loveless, at almost every
place where in school or hospital, in gaudy
harem or in humble cottage, the Gospel
of purity and love is preached to-day, are
little companies of Persian Christians, men
and women who, disowned, impoverished,
persecuted, in peril of imprisonment and
death, count it a joy to suffer for Christ's
sake.  Truly in Persia are heroic outposts
of the Christian Church.

Ion Keith-Falconer and Arabia.
</span>
</p>

<p>
We close this chapter with a short picture
of one of the noble men who have given
their lives to win the way into Arabia.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
'See, in the purpose of God for Arabia, that lad
of promise, lovable, thoughtful, strong in mind and
body, in his noble Scottish home.  See him at
Harrow, then at Cambridge, rising above his fellows,
many-sided, full of fire and life.  Watch him at
work, passing rapidly from form to form at Harrow,
taking a first in one Tripos and then another at
Cambridge, good at mathematics, brilliant at
languages, a born teacher, so exact in his working
that he masters Dutch Grammar in three weeks
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P185"></a>185}</span>
rather than leave a book in that language, which
bore upon a lecture, unread.  Watch him at
play&mdash;bicycling from John o' Groats to Land's End, and
winning the Bicycling Championship of England,
a man of superb physique and training, "as hard
as nails."  Watch him at his special hobby&mdash;shorthand,
an expert verbatim reporter, the chosen
writer on phonography in the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>.
Down in the slums of Cambridge, or in the
East End of London, you may find him too, now
raising, or himself giving, funds for some enterprise,
now addressing a great meeting, now sitting beside
a man who seeks a way to Christ.
</p>

<p class="quote">
'For Ion Keith-Falconer is more than student
and athlete&mdash;beyond the power of brain and muscle
there lies a heart which beats true to its Master,
"fervent still after all the turmoil of a great
Public School and the more subtle temptations of a
great University."
</p>

<p class="quote">
Surely scholarship and Cambridge claim such a
man as this?  At nine-and-twenty we find him
a learned professor in Cambridge, at thirty a
missionary to Arabia, at thirty-one, only six months
after he left England, we stand by his grave, the
black mountainous rocks of Aden lie behind us,
and the white sandy shore of Arabia edges the
limitless stretch of the ocean beyond.
</p>

<p class="quote">
From one point of view, Keith-Falconer's
missionary career was disastrous and a dislocation.
From another, his going was the most natural thing
in the world.  Young, strong, free, a master of
Arabic, he had the constraining love of Christ
within him, and a vision of the Moslem
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P186"></a>186}</span>
world&mdash;especially Arabia&mdash;before.  Speaking for the last
time before he left Scotland, he said:
</p>

<p class="quote">
'"<i>While vast continents are shrouded in almost utter
darkness, and hundreds of millions suffer the horrors
of heathenism, and of Islam, the burden of proof lies
upon you to show that the circumstances in which
God has placed you were meant by Him to keep you
out of the foreign mission-field.</i>"
</p>

<p class="quote">
'The purpose of the strong man to spend and be
spent in the Cause shines out in those last short
months.  We see him building at Sheikh Othman
a centre for his work, talking with patients in the
mat-verandah, dropping into coffee-shops to meet in
friendly intercourse with the Moslems he loved,
picking up and carrying with the aid of his devoted
colleague a sick man left to die in the street.
Then the fever-mists gather, and the scholar-missionary's
death claims Arabia for her true Lord.
</p>

<p class="quote">
'The missionary chapter of Ion Keith-Falconer's
life closed quickly, but the eyes of Christians were
opened to the land for which he died.'
</p>

<p><br></p>

Is there such a thing as waste in God's
economy?  Is it not written 'whoso loseth
his life, the same shall find it'?

<span class="sidenote">
The Story of Islam.
</span>
</p>

<p>
We have reached the end of the telling
of our story.  Let our minds move over it
again once more.  Thirteen hundred years
ago in Arabia, an insignificant, untamed,
untaught 'Land of the Desert,' there
arose an Arab man who, forsaking idols,
believed utterly in God.  His followers
poured forth into the world with a Faith
that carried all before them.  That Faith
broke the great imperial civilizations of its
day, and bore down the timid standards of
a corrupt and palsied Church.  Occupying
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P189"></a>189}</span>
the Mediterranean countries and the sites
of the ancient empires, it established itself
as the greatest ruling force the world had
ever known.  In spite of the rise of
younger nations, the magnificence of
medieval Europe, the growth of science
and the arts of civilization and of war, in
spite of many rival empires in the modern
'scramble for the world,' Islam still holds
with its tenacious grip the thoughts and
hearts of men.  It dominates to-day
one-seventh of mankind, moving still to fresh
conquests of the Faith.  We have traced
that Faith in history and seen it settling like
a deadly blight upon the nations, chilling
and paralyzing the moral life of man.  We
have examined it in its essential meaning
and significance.
</p>

<p>
Islam rises up before us in its tremendous
rugged strength, leagued with the
wild nature of 200 millions of our
fellow-men, and overshadowing Christendom.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Challenge of Islam.

<p>
'The only one of the great religions to

categorically denies the truth of Christianity:
the only one that has in the past
signally defeated Christianity: the only one
that seriously disputes the world with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P190"></a>190}</span>

parts of the world, is to-day forestalling
and gaining on Christianity.'[<a id="chap12fn1text"></a><a href="#chap12fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Isaiah.
</span>
</p>

<p>
In another Eastern land 1,200 years
before Mohammed, there lived another
Prophet.  The country that he loved with
a passionate devotion was in sore straits.
Two mighty kingdoms, one on either side,
were driving their highways across it, and
threatening to overwhelm it.  The very
religion which had been the secret of its
greatness was challenged and endangered.
Men's hearts were full of fear.  To one
man was given a vision of hope.  He alone
among his people pierced the clouds that
overcast the sky, and saw the light, and
believed with all his soul in the vision that
he saw&mdash;the vision of the kingdom that
should be, the rule of righteousness and joy
and peace, whose ensign should be Holiness
to the Lord.  And seeing the future till to
him it was present, he worded it thus:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="smcap">
Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given;
and the government shall be upon his shoulder:
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P191"></a>191}</span>
and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor,
Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of
Peace.  Of the increase of his government and of
peace there shall be no end ... to establish it and
to uphold it with judgment and with righteousness
from henceforth even for ever.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And St. John upon the summit of a
later day painted with a fuller glory the
vision of the City that shall be:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord
God the Almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple
thereof.  and the city hath no need of the sun,
neither of the moon, to shine upon it: for the
Glory of God did lighten it, and the lamp thereof
is the Lamb.  And the nations shall walk amidst
the light thereof: and the kings of the earth do
bring their glory into it.  And the gates thereof
shall in no wise be shut by day (for there shall
be no night there): and they shall bring the
glory and the honour of the nations into it: and
there shall in no wise enter into it anything
unclean, or he that maketh an abomination and a lie:
but only they which are written in the Lamb's
Book of Life.
</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p>
It is the purest form of the old-world
vision of the 'Golden Age,' and our hearts
acclaim it still.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Christ's Kingdom.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Here upon this present, prosaic earth
to-day, God is laying by human hands the
foundations, broad and deep and true, of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P192"></a>192}</span>
that City yet to be.  To this world, where
sin threw down the gage of battle, the
Child was born.  Here He fought and
triumphed, and upon this earth was raised
His cross, the token of the final victory.
Here among men in <i>this</i> present world, the
battle must be waged, the Kingdom comes.
</p>

<p>
Every sin, every falsehood, every
injustice, every cruelty, every wrong, may
challenge but they do not deny that
Kingdom&mdash;Islam does.
</p>

<p>
Bringing its ideals down to the level of
our nature, it denies the best in man, and
denies the Christ of God&mdash;the One who alone
has triumphed and in whose triumph lies
man's only hope.  Give the world to Islam,
and man's highest vision is gone for ever.

<span class="sidenote">
Christian and Moslem.
</span>
</p>

<p>
And so we go to meet the Moslem, and
he stands before us strong, fearless, brave,
determined.  What have we Christians
that we can say to him?  What can we
give?  What has he already got?
</p>

<p>
First, he has God, God all-powerful,
all-knowing, Master of the Universe and Lord
of men.  He has a Prophet, human also as
himself, to be at the last day, so he says, his
mediator in God's presence, pleading there
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P193"></a>193}</span>
man's weakness before God.[<a id="chap12fn2text"></a><a href="#chap12fn2">2</a>]  Behind him,
with him, around him, stands that great
Moslem brotherhood of the 'believers'
transcending all race, proud and isolated,
mysterious in its kindling warmth and
strange fanaticism.  For himself, and for
them he has his book&mdash;his Korân&mdash;the
final word of God.  In it he finds his
simple rule of conduct, the things that he
must do, his prayer, his almsgiving, the
blessing of the pilgrimage, the rules for
all his life&mdash;nothing impossible in them
from first to last, no entanglement of
conscience or of principles, no insistence upon
the spirit in which they must be carried
out.  He has his call to service too, for the
honour of the Prophet and the advancement
of the Faith.  And on beyond&mdash;his
Paradise, the more attractive because so
very like this earth without its pains.

MOSLEM BOY-FACES (TUNIS).<br>
 '<i>What have we Christians that we can say to them?</i>'
</p>

<p>
What can we say?  Talk about compromise
between these two religions?  Ask
him, ask any Moslem, ask the Korân.  The
two are essentially, absolutely, and for
ever, mutually contradictory and mutually
exclusive.  The Hindu and the Chinese
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P194"></a>194}</span>
may indeed set Christ in their Pantheons.
But a Moslem set Christ beside the
Prophet?  <i>Never!</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Proof of Christ.
</span>
</p>

<p>
What then have we to offer?  Must we
Christians cringe in shame and weakness
before his grim unthinking faith and
rugged earnestness?  It is a searching
question.  Superior knowledge, or as we
think a more complete philosophy of
things, does not give us a right to interfere
with his belief.  He starts with an inherent
and determined disbelief in the claim of
Christ, it is the very core of his religion.
He will not listen to our story.  He wants
<i>the proof</i> of Christ.
</p>

<p>
And where shall the proof of Christ be
found?  There is one only answer, Christ
the Son of God, the Son of Man, staked all
upon the Christian&mdash;His Spirit in the
Christian,&mdash;all that story, wrought out in
suffering and tears, and the shedding of
His blood, His triumph over death, His
ascension on high, to be told and retold
and told again <i>in the life</i> of the Christian.
It was always so, He meant it to be so; it
was His plan, part of the eternal purpose
of God for the Redemption of the World.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Commission.
</span>
</p>

<p>
And so the commission to teach all
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P195"></a>195}</span>
nations[<a id="chap12fn3text"></a><a href="#chap12fn3">3</a>] and the promise of the Spirit
stand together&mdash;two things which God
hath joined&mdash;the Witness and the Spirit.
</p>

<p>
In the power and fulness of that Spirit,
the little company of weak and vacillating
fishermen with their few companions went
out fearlessly to win the world for Christ.
They dared to believe what He had said&mdash;that
'greater works' remained for them to
do <i>because</i> He had gone to the Father.
</p>

<p>
What mattered then the frowning mask
of things, the deadness of the decadent old
world, the hateful lust of Grecian cities, the
murderous gladiatorial games, scourgings,
imprisonments, death?  They never doubted
the final triumph.  Let St. Paul speak out
his mind&mdash;the secret of the final triumph:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="smcap">
Have this mind in you, which was also in
Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God,
counted it not a prize to be on an equality with
God, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a
servant, being made in the likeness of men; and
being found in fashion as a man, he humbled
Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, yea,
the death of the cross.  Wherefore also God
highly exalted Him, and gave unto Him the name
which is above every name; that in the name of
Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven
and things on earth and things under the earth.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P196"></a>196}</span>
</p>

<p>
Hear St. Paul again, revealing the secret
of his own life, 'I live: yet not I, but
CHRIST LIVETH IN ME.'
</p>

<p>
We may answer the Moslem just in
proportion as that is true of us&mdash;made true
by the Holy Spirit.
</p>

<p>
What else was it in Raymund Lull that
made him the one apostle of the Moslems
of his day?  Whence else came Henry
Martyn's quiet, dauntless faith?  What else
was the source of Ion Keith-Falconer's
heroic devotion?  To the deadness of
Islam, they brought the living Christ:
'The Life was the Light of men.'
</p>

<p>
The Moslem has blessed us by asking us
the question, by forcing us to ask it of
ourselves!
</p>

<p>
The age of the apostles is not a closed
chapter of history, like the departed glory
of Athens or the Elizabethan age.  God
still moves amid His Church.

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Stirring of the Nations.
</span>
</p>

<p>
We have been called to live in this
twentieth century amid the most tremendous
events&mdash;save one&mdash;the world has ever
known.  Let us remind ourselves that before
the guns of the Great War rolled their
terrible thunder, things had been happening
in Asia and the East, and particularly in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P197"></a>197}</span>
Moslem world, which were of hardly less
importance than the war itself.
</p>

<p>
The great nations of Asia awoke, as
though shaken from an age-long sleep by
some mighty galvanic shock.  One after
another the customs, traditions, and beliefs
of centuries have been cast aside.  Everywhere
is felt the pulse of new ambitions
and the desire to get abreast of the modern
peoples of the world.  Hence mighty and
sweeping movements for education and
reform, showing themselves hardly less
in Turkey and Egypt than in China and
India, in this twentieth century, creating
a new desire to learn, a deeper sense of
need, a readiness to consider and weigh
new propositions, and an altogether new
opportunity for preaching the eternal
Gospel of life, the only true foundation
upon which men and nations can build.
</p>

<p>
And now we are passing through times
such as Britain has never known before.
The whole nation is pouring out its best,
giving them, as it believes, as sacrifices
for the world's freedom and the life of
generations to come.
</p>

<p>
The war will be over some day, and
those who survive it and those who come
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P198"></a>198}</span>
after will not forget their glorious dead.
They will realize that these lives were
given to redeem Britain's opportunity.
</p>

<p>
It will lie with the present generation of
Britain's schoolboys to see to it that they
did not purchase that opportunity in vain.

written, and for whom it has been revised
in barracks, will come the nobler opportunity
of the truly holy war&mdash;the rebuilding
of the world's waste places, the healing
of its sores, the substitution of truth and
purity where now there is falsehood and
wrong.  It is the opportunity of the ages.
What can we say of it all but this&mdash;'God
fulfils Himself in many ways'?  It
is God, God moving behind and shaping
history towards its goal.

The Call of Christ.

<p>
Christ walks to-day upon our streets,
He is with us in our homes, He draws
near to our great schools, He stands over
us as we kneel in prayer, seeking for young
knights of His cross, weak enough to lean
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P199"></a>199}</span>
on His great strength; dependent enough
to trust with childlike faith; willing to
be made pure enough to see God; true
enough to reveal His love to men; brave
enough to make a great adventure for His
sake; utterly His, that in them for the
sake of the great needy Moslem world
He may fulfil His word:
</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p>
Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that
believeth on Me, the works that I do shall
he do also; and greater works than these
shall he do; because I go unto the Father.
</p>

<p>
And whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that
will I do, that the Father may be glorified in
the Son.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
